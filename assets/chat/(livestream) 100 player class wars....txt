51:22 | sidereal: smash

52:02 | literatemax: he is 2%
52:13 | nequ: do 72 rounds on each map
52:14 | Inc0m1ng: we already know the best class is engineer anyways
52:16 | Bobby Joe: You should've done this on PASS Time instead.
52:18 | joey jojo: this shit aint for fun it's for science
52:23 | Super Sain: @igorka5. exe your math is wrong
52:23 | Krackin Gibbs: you're basically attempting to find what class stacks the best
52:37 | Space Monkeys: Shoulda played in dust bowl and compared data with normal class wars
52:44 | Bryan Ng Dawei: There are dedicated class war servers and it is already agreed upon that Engineers are the most OP class. 
52:46 | Bravo Defeated: wow OT
52:49 | Super Sain: this is probably the fairest match that will happen today
52:53 | igorka5. exe: my math is wrong but it's more dramatic that way
52:55 | Bravo Defeated: lmao
53:03 | Le mont: Aw nah, not dust bowl

55:07 | Rasmus Vaik: ptsd...
55:12 | Leo: bison is based tho
55:20 | Spring_nottheseason: "I am shounic, femboy transformed"
55:49 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: real question is WHO is the client? and how much did it pay?
56:02 | Bravo Defeated: bison seem viable
56:09 | Super Sain: @Cris_P_Bacon BBQ chat and 700$
56:10 | segadoeswhatnintendont: bison is better in 100 players tho

1:01:15 | Mavis: Old wooden shield > rockets
1:01:18 | Super Sain: @shounic Ok actually though can you add something that answers the "how much did they pay" and "why are you a femboy" because it is actually getting annoying how much it's asked
1:01:25 | Eric Saavedra: I'm stroking it rn with lotion to your femboy avatar
1:01:27 | Le mont: Imagine being a silly bean
1:01:32 | Dan: the server is straight up unjoinable rn you need some sort of queue system

1:02:07 | Kaka-Carrot Cake: i know you got paid but... that is brutal
1:02:17 | Slippery_: "700$ is 700$"
1:02:18 | Funny Man haha: isn't shounic a furry? i mean, check out his channel icon and mascot he always uses. that shits a fursona.

1:03:59 | Krackin Gibbs: @Funny Man haha from what I understand, a fursona is usually an anthropomorphic animal/animal-like creature of some sort. the avatar chat paid him to use is just a femboy wearing a cat hoodie
1:04:06 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: never bothered changing? or just said "guess it will do" and left it be?
1:04:10 | Carlos📗🏆: lol
1:04:15 | Super Sain: shounic may be a femboy, bet he ain't a furry

1:12:29 | itchylol742: 70 spies vs 30 soldiers
1:12:30 | Zanagoth: stream sniping the spy in spy v soldier is like salting the wound LMAO

1:14:32 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: hey shonic can you show us your spray?
1:14:39 | June: I WAS IN THE SERVER
1:14:40 | The Real Pika: theres a reason heavy is top tier in classwars
1:14:44 | FBI: I found cp in your hard drive.
1:14:47 | LifeOverflow: still waiting for spot
1:14:47 | June: AND GAME CRASHES.
1:14:49 | Thespikedballofdoom: @Super Sain no i have to act like an asshole

1:15:10 | Billy: cuuuuuuuute
1:15:16 | Bravo Defeated: cool spray
1:15:18 | Super Sain: "stupid"?
1:15:21 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: tf2 is based on free choice of images
1:15:22 | Super Sain: nah that's based as hell
1:15:23 | dermitio: how are hevies winning
1:15:25 | Funny Man haha: @shounic dude my spray when I was 13 still works, and it HAS to be steam cloud saved, because ive gone through 3 computers since then and its the same thing.
1:15:25 | Zergling: mudkip is lit
1:15:25 | Sofu: thank god he didn't pull a pyrocynical type move
1:15:25 | lostme: share the spray with the masses
1:15:37 | VideoDenification: @shounic, do you think that TF2 is friendly to noobs in this state? Is it worth embarking into?
1:15:54 | nick 2: yeah noob friendly imo?
1:15:59 | zygis: we need map change
1:16:11 | (New member) Shamus: :3
1:16:18 | nick 2: its not like hopping into quake or something
1:16:22 | zygis: we need map change
1:16:26 | nick 2: you can have fun at any skill level tbh
1:16:32 | Inc0m1ng: play on the weekend to avoid bots though
1:16:33 | Some Guy On The Internet: Tf2 is a game that is stupid in a fun way
1:16:50 | VideoDenification: I'm talking about the bot crisis and whatnot
1:16:51 | Pixe\_: Tf2 is probably at its peak.I mean it can tank a decade with no update.
1:16:51 | Kellie Lienne: uncletopia is great for noobs
1:16:53 | Pocky In My Nostrils: theres someone with a iron curtain named shounic bussy
1:16:54 | Super Sain: @VideoDenification yes, just as a beginner tip half of the buttons in the main menu are pointless so don't get overwhelmed
1:16:54 | Carlos📗🏆: :3
1:16:56 | DunmoDoh: people only get mad at you for being bad if they're an ass or if its mvm
1:16:57 | Le mont: I think the problem with new players is finding where they can just play. Skial might be aight or smth
1:16:58 | · FrostedGeulleisia: yeah like i sucked as sniper but am slowly getting better
1:16:58 | Bravo Defeated: except that one weeb spy
1:16:59 | Krackin Gibbs: time, there was a cost of time
1:17:01 | · FrostedGeulleisia: though i still main engie
1:17:02 | Bobby Joe: Here's the number one thing new TF2 players need to remember: Old TF2 didn't have Casual. You were encouraged to play on community servers. If you're not having fun on Casual, play community!
1:17:08 | Some Guy On The Internet: If bots are a concern, play on community servers.
1:17:10 | Марк: are you a femboy?
1:17:12 | Spring_nottheseason: the cost for you was being forced to use a femboy
1:17:33 | Rishav Barua: I never play normal tf2 anymore. 
1:17:45 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: you had to chose bewtwen 1 of these 2 option what would it be?: no COs on public but sprays allowed, or no sprays on public but COs allowed.
1:17:56 | Dirtblokje: tf2maps discord meanwhile is a big circlejerk
1:17:58 | Inc0m1ng: that obama spray lmao
1:17:58 | lostme: shounic being wholesome?! WHAT?!!
1:18:02 | Bobby Joe: Don't go near r/TF2. That stuff is braindead.
1:18:02 | Fear Brownizz: tf2 comunity is very welcoming but very autistic
1:18:03 | BananowyBT: mvm players are mostly just toxic
1:18:04 | Col. Klink 1965: Shounic spreading misinformation about the TF2 community
1:18:19 | wireddude1: This is the TF2 GameCube port?
1:18:19 | Bobby Joe: @Dirtblokje WDYM dawg? Those are the nicest people you'll ever meet
1:18:22 | Yeti's Mods: just pick pyro or heavy and go to town
1:18:25 | Ghostler: i'm back
1:18:28 | Spring_nottheseason: how is tf2maps a cirlcejerk though
1:18:30 | Ghostler: now I smell good for the femboy
1:18:40 | Ghostler: I hope everyone else took your showers aswell
1:18:42 | Bravo Defeated: birds a feather
1:18:43 | Bobby Joe: Yeah how the fuck is tf2maps a circlejerk? They're the nicest, most helpful people in the world.
1:18:45 | Le mont: I like the flying demos.
1:18:46 | _n5_'''4_____: scout vs medic?
1:18:57 | Yeti's Mods: r/circlejerk is pretty inclusive 
1:18:58 | Dirtblokje: @Bobby Joe unless if your well known there (mods etc) they dontgive a shit about you
1:18:59 | LoyalDevotee17: is it too late to join if I wanted too?
1:19:10 | Le mont: Just try to joib
1:19:12 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: how does it feel to be a menace to society?
1:19:13 | surely: more specifically I think some communities are a circlejerk where you have to already know all the insider info before you can talk, that's been my experience with some discord servers
1:19:16 | lostme: miniguns aren't chip damage what
1:19:18 | Super Sain: @LoyalDevotee17 only if someone leaved cuz it's full atm
1:19:24 | LanFour: "Chat paid me to do this" -Famous last words
1:19:34 | András Kassai: sho you should've done it so after each round we play again on the other team
1:19:34 | Billy: ANOTHER NOSE BLEED?
1:19:36 | Bobby Joe: Mapping for this game is HARD, those people understand. They're there to help you and support you.
1:19:37 | Sumerian Copper Merchant: you are dying! !
1:19:44 | uzr: can’t believe theres 500 people watching femboy shounic
1:19:45 | Krackin Gibbs: wait, shounic has casual nosebleeds? weird
1:19:48 | Bobby Joe: nosebleed? that's very femboy behavior
1:19:48 | Yoloc4th: mose bleeds every time he looks at femshou
1:19:55 | Bryan Ng Dawei: the demo should probably have shot through chokes but well now heavy got point it is borderline impossible to retake
1:19:58 | Nimble Snek: I beg your pardon?`
1:19:59 | unforseen consequencer: i'm not a drug dealer, chat paid 70000 USD
1:19:59 | lostme: shounic is anime confirmed?
1:20:00 | surely: could you add your nosebleed to your on screen femboy
1:20:01 | Billy: Check your blood pressure man
1:20:01 | Orilas: Press E
1:20:01 | Ghostler: "nose bleed because of the femboy" that's crazy
1:20:05 | LoyalDevotee17: the blood loss stat hasn't filled up yet
1:20:06 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: put your finger on your bleeding nose great idea!
1:20:08 | Carlos📗🏆: femshou is to powerful
1:20:09 | LanFour: nosebleed = anime = femboy
1:20:11 | DunmoDoh: "if i put my finger in my nose and dig around a lil i can find a candy"
1:20:12 | Ghostler: hold Q to heal
1:20:14 | 0x7: I joined at the right time
1:20:14 | Tired: not drinking enough water
1:20:16 | Yeti's Mods: i get nosebleeds as well
1:20:22 | Rishav Barua: Some demoman has laid stickies at spawn… why?
1:20:24 | uzr: i guess the secret to success is being a femboy
1:20:29 | Bobby Joe: make the femboy bloody all over
1:20:31 | Rasmus Vaik: artificial nosebleed
1:20:32 | DrTerror: shounic come to spawn we're having lunch
1:20:32 | Ghostler: poor little femboy 
1:20:35 | lostme: that heavy threw a snack to help with nosebleed lol
1:20:39 | Inc0m1ng: people are just genetically inferior? cringe
1:20:42 | Ion Cave Grandma: Chat everyone go drink some water. Stay hydrated 
1:20:46 | BananowyBT: people mostly watching and not chatting
1:20:46 | Jiffy360: Join the stream and the first thing I hear is you talking about putting your finger up your nose lmao
1:20:46 | · FrostedGeulleisia: some cultures associate nosebleeds with arousal :)
1:20:47 | 0x7: Is it weird that I envy people that nosebleed? Blood is pretty
1:20:48 | Some Random Dude: you had the soldering iron up ur nose to fix it?
1:20:51 | Yoloc4th: ioin no i refuse
1:20:51 | Yeti's Mods: yep me too
1:20:53 | DoctorSubstance: genetic cocaine
1:20:54 | Le mont: I mean, it really just do be like that. Dry air tends to dry up your nose and make it bleed
1:20:55 | SlimeMoldConfucius: 2/2 on times I have watched your stream and you have had a nosebleed
1:20:57 | Rasmus Vaik: ive never had a nosebleed
1:20:57 | Cris_P_Bacon BBQ: we need to dig deeper... we need to strike GOLD in those nostrels.
1:21:10 | Krackin Gibbs: ngl, this is the first time I've heard of someone just having a casual nosebleed... I assume it happens often?

1:24:13 | nick 2: you assume people here have skill
1:24:14 | Ghostler: femboy hud probably
1:24:17 | Carlos📗🏆: what
1:24:18 | Grolinol: just shoot good
1:24:19 | DrTerror: Its an even fight unless the spy cant aim, which is 80% of the time

1:34:16 | Rishav Barua: racism?
1:34:35 | Le mont: Pyros have an advantage just because of their 'ease of damage' 50 people can burn you alive. However, can 50 people hit 2 pipes.. without having them reflected?
1:34:42 | Ghostler: @shounic if you don't mind i'm gonna go draw you
1:34:47 | Cosmic0508: y'know, it might be an actually good strat to just iron bomber jump and charge out of the sky

2:04:55 | AxolotlFood: Yooooo the aus accent, Im aus

2:05:03 | lostme: sniper winning pog
2:05:08 | EvGen: No way snipers winning here
2:05:11 | me when i: there are so many scouts that you have a statistically high chance of hitting a scout
2:05:17 | Le mont: The scout misquotes have arrived
2:05:18 | Valles: why is shounic's ai character thing looking like that
2:05:20 | SNCY: How join

2:05:40 | Inc0m1ng: shounic is a certified friendly killer
2:05:40 | SNCY: How join 
2:05:40 | Splatana: @Valles He got paid 700 dollars to be femboy until someone pays him a ton of money to go back to normal
2:05:40 | dermitio: dont bother charging
2:05:41 | Dis: based scout
2:05:42 | Stolen Comment Corp.: use piss
2:05:52 | AxolotlFood: PISS JAR PISS JAR PISS JAR PISS JAR
2:05:59 | Stolen Comment Corp.: piss
2:06:03 | Super Sain: @Valles bruh the word AI is so over-saturated at this point that is has lost it's actual meaning
2:06:04 | kingr0b3rt0: jarate would be good for coating a group
2:06:15 | trystar78: cleaner bush wacka and huntsman or classic
2:06:18 | Audrius Skebas: Lucksman :/
2:06:26 | SneakyBeaky: the piss objectively the best item for this
2:06:26 | Le mont: Dang that scout was snagging frags with just the bat lol
2:06:49 | Eric Saavedra: it's pretty bad
2:06:50 | Worm enjoyer2015: turn the aimbot plugin back on
2:06:52 | lostme: at least your screen isn't yellow 24/7
2:06:54 | Soulja: at least you don't get spawncamped in this matchup, which is a good thing for snipers
2:07:02 | SneakyBeaky: give the snipers aimbo
2:07:04 | kingr0b3rt0: jarate spam helps a lot to take out the scouts in one hit
2:07:16 | DrTerror: double jump:
2:07:46 | Splatana: Alt fire
2:07:47 | DunmoDoh: m2
2:07:47 | SneakyBeaky: alt fire

2:07:50 | kingr0b3rt0: alt
2:07:51 | KptKosmit91: right mouse
2:07:53 | Dis: rmb
2:08:00 | Inc0m1ng: shounic have you actually played tf2?
2:08:01 | Luc Troti: You can farm "crikey" off of bonk'd scouts :)
2:08:02 | SneakyBeaky: alt + f4
2:08:10 | trystar78: yep
2:08:12 | trystar78: B)]
2:08:17 | trystar78: crikey is OP
2:08:19 | trystar78: B)))
2:08:37 | Mr. Tatortot: it just does for some reason
2:08:37 | Neal: you can even farm crikey with buildings
2:08:42 | DunmoDoh: bonk scouts still give you crikey
2:08:43 | lostme: it just does
2:08:44 | trystar78: ^
2:08:54 | KptKosmit91: scouts don't place buildings usually tho
2:08:55 | Mr. Tatortot: crikey can be farmed off anything you can hit
2:08:55 | trystar78: stronk
2:08:56 | SneakyBeaky: the fucking scout screams of pain
2:09:06 | kingr0b3rt0: the chicken LOL
2:09:16 | kingr0b3rt0: he wanted to share the kfc
2:09:27 | EvGen: S O M E
2:09:28 | Le mont: I admire that
2:09:28 | Splatana: Bro turned it into CSGO with all the Smgs :skull:
2:09:31 | Kane: surely the lucksman is better
2:09:41 | Ripp_: wait chat paid 700USD?
2:09:48 | Le mont: Yes.
2:10:01 | Ripp_: I too would turn into a femboy for $700
2:10:05 | Darmug: Will this be a main channel upload?
2:10:09 | kingr0b3rt0: now if all the snipers had awps that would really be cs:go 
2:10:12 | SneakyBeaky: you of all people should know that the huntsman is good because of it's massive headshot range
2:10:16 | autumn Chan: the carbine sucks
2:10:35 | Darmug: Ok
2:10:43 | Inc0m1ng: this man has never touched the cs ak in his life lmao
2:10:57 | Prostě Cz: :face-orange-biting-nails:
2:11:06 | lostme: will all your footage have a femboy in the corner?
2:11:12 | SneakyBeaky: probably the same reason medics can farm uber off bonk scouts
2:11:13 | Splatana: I mean you could try the Machina near the point?
2:11:15 | dermitio: jarate is better
2:11:17 | dermitio: just melee
2:11:18 | Darmug: You should probably do a video on why you can farm hits off of a bonked scout.
2:11:26 | kingr0b3rt0: i would think that huntsman, jarate and bushwacka would be the play but maybe not
2:11:33 | BananowyBT: at least not spawn camped
2:11:34 | Neal: huntsman, half smg half jarate sounds like the only way to have a chance
2:11:37 | Inc0m1ng: you do if you one tap 
2:11:40 | Inc0m1ng: no spray control needed
2:11:47 | Splatana: Source Spagetti moment
2:11:49 | Le mont: Yea
2:11:52 | SneakyBeaky: its intended
2:12:06 | Ripp_: testing everything is hard =(
2:12:11 | Super Sain: crazy how this chat cycles between actually talking about the game and talking about pregnant femboy furry shounic
2:12:17 | The Sangheili: I'm sure it's not counting damage but just hits
2:12:18 | CubeOfGD: help
2:12:21 | Kane: the carbine is already a bad weapon as it is, that "buff" is welcome
2:12:25 | SneakyBeaky: oh no 
2:12:26 | Splatana: @Super Sain We never said he's pregnant bro
2:12:28 | DrTerror: its over

2:14:42 | Zanagoth: men will literally go to therapy before using the short circuit
2:14:48 | Splatana: @Hax1337 Correction, its not enough when the Engi's are spread out, just look at 100 player Junction last and its alamo
2:14:49 | Le mont: Loll
2:14:51 | EvGen: People are not using the short circuit :skull::skull::skull:
2:15:26 | autumn Chan: don't think rounds last long enough for engies to win
2:15:49 | VideoDenification: If Engi team doesn't counterspam with short circuit, then it's over
2:15:49 | BananowyBT: some people prob don't have all the weapons

2:52:38 | AlrexX extras: femboy fursona cam incoming
2:52:42 | Splatana: Everyone should just go the Holiday Punch and Pootis power
2:52:42 | Amd Power: prob
2:52:43 | Kydan McCabe: ohhhhhhhhhhhh
2:52:48 | Scout: I saw the full body in his tabs
2:52:50 | Splatana: The soviet block
2:52:53 | 행hang: So much milk..
2:52:53 | Scout: He's hiding it from us
2:52:57 | Kydan McCabe: I gona join
2:53:00 | BananowyBT: maybe milk can save it
2:53:03 | Funny Man haha: get cummed on @shounic 
2:53:11 | Peppermint Swirl: Soviet russia
2:53:18 | Sam Xiang: Cold War be like

2:53:32 | NectrSpectr: I've yet to meet one that can outsmart boolet
2:53:33 | Inc0m1ng: incoming?
2:53:34 | Sam Xiang: This feels something like Lanchester's Square Law going on
2:53:38 | Eyjafjallajökull Skjálfandafljót: welcome to syberia motherfuckers

2:54:17 | Eyjafjallajökull Skjálfandafljót: go fat scout 
2:54:21 | 행hang: Milk-soaked russian men
2:54:23 | Red winning smile alt ac: Swich to scout
2:54:27 | Royce Bracket: shounic you need to find 50 invite level scouts and see if they can beat 50 pub heavies
2:54:38 | lostme: "possible" look at the top of the screen, man
2:54:38 | Fer: Do a flip
2:54:44 | Mr. Tatortot: everytime you said "it should be possible" it never worked out
2:54:46 | Fogapod: goatse spray again lmao
2:54:49 | Sam Xiang: TBH I don't think it would be
2:54:54 | Great Hammer Enjoyer: scout vs fat scout
2:54:59 | Kydan McCabe: The scariest heavy is just the one dancing.
2:55:00 | Sam Xiang: Heavies get exponentially stronger the more there are of them
2:55:02 | Red winning smile alt ac: killbind with gloves equiped and crouch
2:55:06 | TheBevil: oh this is funny
2:55:09 | Splatana: Everyone is using the Natascha, nice
2:55:10 | autumn Chan: 3 spawn campings in a row
2:55:19 | jumpypyw0: bonk tauntkill
2:55:31 | Red winning smile alt ac: become a spy and disguise as scout
2:55:44 | Sam Xiang: So like 1v1 scout has a decent chance, but 50v50 there's no way to draw enough heavies off to isolate
2:55:49 | DrTerror: You're a monster
2:55:50 | autumn Chan: cruel
2:55:53 | DrTerror: You killed my friend
2:55:57 | DrTerror: how could you
2:55:57 | BananowyBT: evil
2:56:01 | Spring_nottheseason: this shit so ass (red team here)
2:56:11 | Red winning smile alt ac: :face-blue-smiling:use spy
2:56:15 | Joshua Pinkham: payback
2:56:17 | Inc0m1ng: "I will" like you individually stopped all the scouts lol
2:56:23 | Splatana: Alright I'm off, got the see the incredible Engi comesbacks, spy gaming, the reaction video and the insane vcs. Cya, can't wait for the video!
2:56:30 | Not daily but good memes: U guys need a medic 
2:56:32 | AlrexX extras: is anyone keeping track of the wins
2:56:36 | Sam Xiang: sayonara splatana
2:56:38 | Red winning smile alt ac: swich to medic
2:56:53 | Not daily but good memes: Real
2:56:58 | Red winning smile alt ac: medic?
2:57:07 | Mod Trash Fire: did you remove heavy vs scout?
2:57:12 | Kydan McCabe: When will I get a turn to play?!?!
2:57:12 | Inc0m1ng: this should be interesting
2:57:13 | autumn Chan: another spawn camp
2:57:17 | Sam Xiang: Is this the "switch to medic" you guys were asking for
2:57:18 | Carlos📗🏆: oh no
2:57:21 | Red winning smile alt ac: SENTRY HOOOHOHAHAAHAHA WOHAAHA HA HA HA
2:57:21 | DrTerror: we@re fiucekd
2:57:23 | Inc0m1ng: how many more rounds do we have left?
2:57:24 | Not daily but good memes: Yes
2:57:24 | Kydan McCabe: Also it is Engi, not "Engy"
2:57:30 | Fogapod: class wars funniest gamemode tbh. could there be a server vote to turn it on/off maybe, could that ever work?
2:57:40 | Mod Trash Fire: @Inc0m1ng over half i think maybe
2:57:41 | lostme: Edgy
2:57:48 | Worm enjoyer2015: dear god
2:58:03 | Kydan McCabe: Nope, lagging, can't get ANY data on the players.
2:58:07 | Carlos📗🏆: dps vs healing
2:58:10 | Red winning smile alt ac: do addcond 75
2:58:14 | 행hang: This looks interesting matchup
2:58:27 | Red winning smile alt ac: do addcond 57
2:58:32 | Meligor San: but uber
2:58:35 | Kydan McCabe: medic loops
2:58:35 | DrTerror: Im a medic main
2:58:38 | Kydan McCabe: medic loops
2:58:41 | DrTerror: this is revenge for my scout 
2:58:42 | Kydan McCabe: medic loops
2:58:45 | Soulja: the immovable wall
2:58:46 | Red winning smile alt ac: uber
2:58:48 | VideoDenification: Battle of the Bulge (1944), colorized
2:58:49 | Kydan McCabe: medic loops are OP.
2:58:58 | SneakyBeaky: the economy has crashed
2:59:00 | Mr. Tatortot: you need to industrialise quicker
2:59:09 | Sam Xiang: I mean engies take time to build up
2:59:16 | Kydan McCabe: if it was medic vs pyro you could just use third to damage all of them.
2:59:42 | Royce Bracket: engies just have to slowly push
2:59:50 | Sam Xiang: Like the metal is slowly trickling in with the dispensers, if this went on for longer the engies might have a good chance
3:00:08 | Sam Xiang: Since then there can be more upgraded sentries and just more metal to go around in general
3:00:10 | rawr261: alamo established
3:00:12 | lostme: you pushed them out of the circle :o
3:00:13 | Joshua Pinkham: Engineer sweep
3:00:14 | Kydan McCabe: Don't clump all of them!!! Makes it too easy to just wipe all of them!
3:00:30 | Sam Xiang: I think clumping sentries against medics is fine
3:00:44 | Sam Xiang: Medics don't really do AOE so
3:00:46 | Worm enjoyer2015: my ears are bleeding from the sentry sounds
3:01:02 | BananowyBT: lots of syringes flying
3:01:07 | Kydan McCabe: The dispensers, don't clump em up, any of your building for that mater!
3:01:18 | Kydan McCabe: tick rate?
3:01:25 | Kotarol: WAIT HE HAS A CHOKER
3:01:34 | Sam Xiang: Yes he does
3:01:54 | Kydan McCabe: I AM IN!
3:02:15 | The Sangheili: Syringes are projectiles and there are just so many syringes as well
3:02:22 | 행hang: Whooooo
3:02:25 | Sam Xiang: Makes sense yes
3:02:25 | speeddemon1092: WOOOO
3:02:26 | Kydan McCabe: I am an engi main, so time for some CHAOS!
3:02:30 | Ivars Dredzels: whoooo
3:02:41 | BananowyBT: whooo
3:02:42 | lostme: woooo
3:02:46 | Kydan McCabe: It is just WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
3:02:48 | Winded: wooooo
3:02:57 | VideoDenification: YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
3:02:58 | Carlos📗🏆: wooooooo
3:03:00 | LLemon: the siren

3:03:04 | Soulja: woooooooooooooo
3:03:06 | 행hang: Yipikiyaheeyaheeya aeiou
3:03:08 | Mod Trash Fire: wOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
3:03:12 | b.: woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
3:03:25 | Allumi: Damn my game completly froze
3:03:27 | Ivars Dredzels: wOOoooOoOo
3:03:33 | Meligor San: nooo
3:03:36 | punn: wooooo
3:03:36 | Allumi: its over for me
3:03:39 | Inc0m1ng: we won't adapt
3:03:42 | VideoDenification: Looks like a Doctor Lalve skit, kek
3:03:49 | Sam Xiang: Yeah without buildings, the medics can roll over the engies
3:03:49 | Mainlookalike22: Your avatar is my current mood
3:04:07 | BananowyBT: once engis get their village upgraded they win
3:04:40 | Kydan McCabe: I AM IN!
3:04:42 | Franz F.: Noone expects the aggressive medic push
3:04:54 | rawr261: they are kritzing
3:05:08 | Sam Xiang: Is this like trench warfare
3:05:13 | Fogapod: medic vs engineer
3:05:45 | Mr. Tatortot: frakking the ground for oil and its outta oil
3:05:45 | Winded: the metal econonmy is in shambles
3:05:50 | Maimai UwU: CUTE PNGTUBER
3:05:51 | Lapps: tbh that femboy look is 1:1 fits how i imagined you based on voice
3:06:08 | Sam Xiang: FR?
3:06:15 | NectrSpectr: I think if each engie runs in with a mini you all might be able to make more space
3:06:19 | Maimai UwU: I don't really see how it's femboy, not every effeminate man is a femboy!
3:06:22 | Sam Xiang: I always just pictured him to be really sleepy all the time
3:06:33 | Carlos📗🏆: the diaper tele
3:06:43 | walala A: This seems fun
3:06:47 | Maimai UwU: The PNG does absolutely fit his voice tho
3:06:49 | Yxoko: how to join a full server i have waited an hour to join with auto retry but nothing
3:06:53 | Bubster: My internet is so bad that im getting beat into server loading every timr
3:06:55 | Yxoko: it’s so hard
3:07:08 | Sam Xiang: Is this what you imagine programmers to look like
3:07:20 | Soulja: engies start slow and then take over the game it seems
3:07:28 | Sam Xiang: Yeah basically
3:07:31 | Mr. Tatortot: will you be doing commentaries on individual match ups ?
3:07:42 | Sam Xiang: If they don't get pushed back to spawn, they will build up and slowly push back
3:07:53 | markus: engiefear
3:07:56 | VideoDenification: Source engine kinda does that to a man
3:07:59 | 행hang: Mmmm asmr
3:08:03 | Sam Xiang: But if this was heavier classes they probably won't be able to push back
3:08:08 | DrTerror: shounic balance the game by giving us 1 spy
3:08:14 | BananowyBT: wooo
3:08:16 | DrTerror: trust me 
3:08:19 | Joshua Pinkham: i demand a rematch for soldier
3:08:23 | DrTerror: I know its not allowed but hear me out
3:08:27 | DrTerror: 1 spy only
3:08:29 | DrTerror: no one will know
3:09:02 | 𝙳𝚒𝚟𝚒𝚜𝚒𝚟𝚎𝟿: wait r u gonna have the femboy in the corner forever? 
3:09:03 | Inc0m1ng: medic's need one engineer tbh
3:09:06 | markus: texas vs germany
3:09:18 | DrTerror: just 30 more to go
3:09:24 | BananowyBT: 1 sentry down 49 to go
3:09:28 | Sam Xiang: Femboy until...someone pays him more than $700?
3:09:32 | punn: texas always wins
3:09:38 | Mod Trash Fire: @Sam Xiang yes
3:09:43 | IShowRoland: “Engineer gaming” -idk how many engineers 
3:09:46 | markus: wooie - the 43 engineers
3:10:00 | Yxoko: YES I JOINED FINALLY

3:10:05 | Sam Xiang: Oh thank you I was trying to answer divisive9
3:10:09 | robotic_pancake: no empty slots :((((((((((((
3:10:09 | punn: engis for the dub
3:10:10 | DrTerror: WOOEEEOEEEOEOEEOEEOEOEOEEOE
3:10:29 | Eric Saavedra: it was 2 rounds
3:10:42 | DrTerror: gg
3:10:49 | Soulja: way more spy
3:10:50 | IShowRoland: Was that class wars?
3:10:52 | BananowyBT: meds would have to destroy the colony at the start
3:10:55 | markus: ubersaw gaming
3:10:56 | Ivars Dredzels: no chance for spy
3:10:58 | Soulja: *yay
3:10:58 | itchylol742: throwing by not using the spycicle smh
3:11:05 | Worm enjoyer2015: finaly a medic dub
3:11:09 | Eyjafjallajökull Skjálfandafljót: this might be close
3:11:30 | lostme: medic wins, wth with "oh no, I'm on the medic team"?
3:12:14 | DrTerror: The spies are becoming 5k hour gods 
3:12:21 | H . A: The spy team need to use their guns
3:12:25 | DrTerror: they're trickstabbing everyone
3:12:41 | rawr261: amongst us
3:12:47 | Inc0m1ng: among us???
3:12:48 | Sam Xiang: amidst us
3:13:19 | H . A: Gun spy charge
3:13:30 | Pointing Device: needle spam is obv more effective than crossbow too
3:13:39 | punn: fraging out wit med
3:13:42 | itchylol742: shoenick stealing copyrighted content
3:13:51 | Soulja: spy can at least oneshot so its not like scout where they just can't get through the overheal
3:13:56 | rawr261: medic one shots from the front with melee
3:14:05 | NectrSpectr: Beyond DPS, Medics also have constant healing
3:14:06 | Sam Xiang: If they clump up they become vulnerable to mass needles
3:14:08 | Lucas: they have a spy mindset
3:14:08 | Gavin: theres no way the spies can win when the medics can just amputator spam
3:14:28 | BananowyBT: spy medic
3:14:31 | DrTerror: imagine calling out spies when theres 50 people 
3:14:35 | Sam Xiang: Also vaccinators yes
3:14:35 | Nessinby: it's not dps vs DPS, it's effective health vs DPS.
3:14:41 | lostme: that medic is a spy
3:14:53 | Plants10000: do engineer vs engineer
3:14:54 | Inc0m1ng: maybe this proves that spy sucks lol
3:14:55 | Sam Xiang: Which can really reduce the effectiveness of gun spies
3:15:14 | ReimuHakureiShrine: did I just hear the PS2 sound
3:15:16 | punn: wait YER might work well...
3:15:23 | GGreenHeart: all they need are a few Eternal Reward spys
3:15:35 | lostme: 3 minutes ago you said "ew, I'm on the medic team" :sho3:
3:15:40 | BananowyBT: medics just heal the damage back
3:15:46 | Personaless: just artificially increase everyone's ping, and the trick stabs can start coming out
3:15:48 | Soulja: at least spies didn't get spawncamped for once!
3:15:58 | FireForger: heavy vs pyro
3:16:04 | Fogapod: can't believe tf2 so poorly balanced. blue team had no chance
3:16:06 | BananowyBT: ambasador would help with the damage
3:16:07 | H . A: What a sad day for France
3:16:25 | DrTerror: im using ambassador and hitting 40 people and still no hitscan
3:16:30 | DrTerror: I love team fortress two
3:16:35 | Carlos📗🏆: blitzkrieg wow

3:39:46 | H . A: Omg

3:39:53 | Col. Klink 1965: This isn’t femboy music chat, it’s not MLP music 
3:39:58 | DrTerror: please roll again
3:40:00 | DrTerror: please no more
3:40:11 | BananowyBT: femboy cooking
3:40:19 | Sam Xiang: Everything can be femboy music, femboy is a state of mind
3:40:19 | Motivated: no no we got this
3:40:19 | shinyjeremy: IT KICKED ME OUT FOR INACTIVITY??
3:40:31 | jujuteux: not just that, heal is divided by 3 while on fire

3:40:50 | Sam Xiang: Yess someone gets it
3:40:51 | Dis: ohhh this is going to be interesting
3:40:59 | Ingenier62: boston be like
3:40:59 | lostme: is this the civil war?
3:41:00 | Spring_nottheseason: sam ur so based for saying that
3:41:04 | Sam Xiang: This isn't the Civil War
3:41:06 | rawr261: the banners are op
3:41:08 | dawhuidhawodjawopdzbt7lr76kl r e6klci32ci : louder
3:41:10 | Plants10000: boston versus patriotism
3:41:11 | Sam Xiang: Civil War would be either scout or soldier vs engie
3:41:18 | Sam Xiang: Cuz north vs south
3:41:19 | Plants10000: scouts are so fucked
3:41:32 | Ingenier62: Americans vs mosquitoes
3:41:36 | BananowyBT: get the high ground
3:41:40 | Worm enjoyer2015: POV the school says no to the army recruiters
3:41:58 | pilly nutty: doubt
3:42:05 | Sam Xiang: Yall need long-range options
3:42:06 | blipDOTavi: :3
3:42:10 | Sam Xiang: in my opinion
3:42:16 | Dis: yeah I'm shit at scout
3:42:22 | lostme: cleaver :3
3:42:24 | Plants10000: that implies the soldier team are comp players too therefore you´d still lose but harder
3:42:25 | Sam Xiang: Yeah IDK if Scout even has that
3:42:30 | nahguy: go sandman and score a home run for the mets
3:42:30 | ButtonMasher: Use the baby face's blaster :slightly_smiling_face: 
3:42:31 | Sam Xiang: So maybe y'all are screwed
3:42:39 | lostme: shortstop
3:42:42 | Stump: Why on earth was that guy using Baby Face Blaster? 
3:42:50 | Vinny: Force-a-nature + Crit-a-Cola could be good
3:42:52 | rawr261: banners are way too op for this
3:42:52 | Pointing Device: shortstop is only a midrange gun too
3:42:58 | Sam Xiang: Yeah
3:43:02 | Sam Xiang: At least this map is not that open
3:43:07 | Sam Xiang: So scouts can close in better
3:43:10 | Stump: I love how weirdly fitting the 3DS Mii Music is for this
3:43:16 | rawr261: open map would be better for scout
3:43:23 | rawr261: kong is so clostrophobic
3:43:37 | Void Drone: Bully the lesser class: The video game
3:43:57 | 행hang: Will you ever change map too
3:44:02 | Stolen Comment Corp.: capitalism in a nutshell
3:44:03 | Ozvoid: Use the shortstop for better range
3:44:17 | Sam Xiang: Not sure if shortstop helps much
3:44:27 | Real_Markiplier: "I'm not a femboy" written above a very femboy looking avatar. Mixed signals over here
3:44:33 | Sam Xiang: Oh I thought it was a doc that explained how the class wars works
3:45:20 | jep0rox: that only works out for one gamemode though
3:45:21 | 행hang:  Cool cool
3:45:25 | Sam Xiang: I feel like I just got lectured by the teacher
3:45:25 | Real_Markiplier: This isn't fun, it's science 
3:45:34 | jep0rox: if you want the full dataset you gotta start again on payload
3:45:37 | jep0rox: and ctf
3:45:37 | jep0rox: etc
3:45:43 | lostme: there's NO fun here, it's only science and business
3:45:45 | CASH CLUCKER: science is fun
3:45:47 | Stolen Comment Corp.: its dumb science
3:45:51 | BananowyBT: be above soldiers all the time if you can
3:46:02 | BananowyBT: and maybe use the milk to heal back
3:46:15 | GlebGuy: I came in to see a femboy playing a femboy while masquerading as a femboy. I hope those 700 bucks will help you with the bills and rent, my dude
3:46:16 | Sam Xiang: Are you collecting statistics like average kills?
3:46:44 | ReimuHakureiShrine: you gotta think like a mosquito
3:46:47 | ButtonMasher: Yes
3:46:55 | Sam Xiang: Fair enough
3:47:02 | jep0rox: no but you're only testing that for koth currently
3:47:06 | Real_Markiplier: You gotta think like a short streamer from Boston
3:47:10 | Radioactivethor: that was a kinda rude response bro
3:47:11 | Nessinby: I wonder how much money it would take to turn him into a catboy lmao
3:47:15 | TheRagebot: why not do multiple of these tests on more maps
3:47:16 | jep0rox: will you do the rest at a later date?
3:47:24 | Stolen Comment Corp.: scouts can at least escape pyros in some way but medics cant even with uber
3:47:25 | TheRagebot: like another stream on another stream
3:47:29 | TheRagebot: map*
3:47:37 | Sam Xiang: I mean if you want to be super scientifically rigorous you would recruit a sample pool that has people across all skill levels
3:47:39 | BananowyBT: use the milk to survive the fight
3:47:39 | GlebGuy: Try rushing your enemy with the stock bat. It's amazingly strong with solid damage, fast attack speed and high crit chance. Soldier's will hesitate shooting point blank
3:47:48 | Sam Xiang: So this obviously isn't like, something he's gonna be writing a paper on
3:47:57 | jep0rox: over multiple days yes
3:47:59 | TheRagebot: yeah it is
3:48:02 | Inc0m1ng: the anaswer is engineer
3:48:07 | ReimuHakureiShrine: is he stupid?
3:48:08 | Sam Xiang: I mean he has a life
3:48:10 | Joshua Pinkham: yes
3:48:15 | Radioactivethor: you COULD compare average kills per match in order to tell which matchups are the most skewed in favor of each class, could you not...?
3:48:16 | jep0rox: 1 map per gamemode
3:48:19 | Sam Xiang: Maybe if he has a grant from the TF2 institution hahha
3:48:21 | mor eknow: shounic i love your new avatar, I didn't know you liked it
3:48:24 | Real_Markiplier: The avatar makes you look like you are crying in despair from being forced to play this
3:48:27 | TheRagebot: hell yeah, its not practical but its fun
3:48:37 | punn: lol
3:48:40 | Real_Markiplier: Medic stomp 
3:48:44 | punn: this gonna be "fun"
3:48:44 | Ozvoid: sold versus med is interesting
3:49:01 | Real_Markiplier: You will drown the soldiers in your bodies 
3:49:06 | Ozvoid: I DONT THINK MEIDCS STOMP
3:49:17 | BananowyBT: explosive damage protection
3:49:17 | ReimuHakureiShrine: touhou
3:49:17 | jep0rox: switch off crossbow
3:49:22 | Inc0m1ng: The medic shits 
3:49:31 | punn: yep spawncamp

3:49:56 | BananowyBT: femboy getting stomped
3:50:00 | GlebGuy: So shounic, what fun stories can you tell us while we wait this round out?
3:50:01 | lostme: Imma go get some food, tell me if medics suddenly win later
3:50:11 | Real_Markiplier: More balanced than an average casual match
3:50:12 | Inc0m1ng: what's been your favorite match up so far shounic
3:50:12 | Sam Xiang: Ah this is what the demo vs sniper looked like from the sniper side
3:50:13 | Worm enjoyer2015: End of WW2 colorized
3:50:15 | 행hang: Literally joever
3:50:19 | GlebGuy: Any DND stories?
3:50:23 | ReimuHakureiShrine: that one medic is betraying the team
3:50:26 | Motivated: femboy stories
3:50:33 | WMM: what server is this game happening on?
3:50:34 | GlebGuy: Oh my God everyone is dead except for that ONE MEDIC
3:50:34 | Gar Field: when did you become a femboy?
3:50:36 | Nessinby: what are some tests that never made it into a video?
3:50:39 | Petshop: Invite me to your vc I'll tell you a story about my high school principal
3:50:44 | Robert Stegmann: Maybe this could have been done a map where soldiers can't spawn camp
3:50:47 | Sam Xiang: What's the most frustrating video to make you've made?
3:50:49 | GlebGuy: Watch the fucking players top left
3:50:55 | H . A: Is Brayden keeping the gates open?
3:51:01 | Maximilian Snyder: what made you decide to come out as a femboy?
3:51:06 | rawr261: Screams of the dammed
3:51:08 | Sam Xiang: Like any editing horror stories?
3:51:10 | Real_Markiplier: I have a feeling that roughly half of this experiment will be spend observing that stacking Medic/Scout/Spy/Sniper is a terrible strategy
3:51:12 | BananowyBT: medic hell
3:51:15 | Sam Xiang: Ah
3:51:22 | Nelson Nicholson: oh good, more shounic catboy
3:51:25 | GlebGuy: Now everyone is dead
3:51:39 | Carlos📗🏆: does coming out as a femboy affect your daily life?

3:51:49 | Worm enjoyer2015: dont hold the door open

3:52:11 | Stolen Comment Corp.: am i hearing someone giving birth holy shir
3:52:31 | Nelson Nicholson: medic giving birth
3:52:34 | mor eknow: how do you know about how some glitches work, is tf2 partly open source???

3:52:48 | Meligor San: skip

3:52:52 | werecat: thanks for making that video
3:52:52 | Sam Xiang: Oh wasn't there a TF2 code leak a while back? he might've referenced that
3:53:02 | Inc0m1ng: still wanna know what your favorite match up so far is 
3:53:20 | Vopros: go next please
3:53:28 | GlebGuy: "Truly Feared Medigun" oh fuck that's someone worth respecting
3:53:30 | Bubster: you should do a vid on the linux wall bug
3:53:30 | TheRagebot: femboy make it end plz
3:53:36 | Nessinby: references the code leaks? he's made several videos directly about those leaks.
3:53:38 | Bubster: -2^n

3:54:35 | Sam Xiang: Join the medic team and tell us more stories
3:54:36 | megascatterbomb: what is this chaos
3:54:39 | Sam Xiang: Oh is he actually playing it
3:54:46 | Carlos📗🏆: circa 1941 Russia Some Random Battle
3:54:46 | Sam Xiang: oh my gosh yes
3:54:57 | Real_Markiplier: Russian femboy bullies a group of elderly German men 
3:55:01 | Sam Xiang: 1941 wouldn't the Soviets be being pushed back
3:55:03 | Petshop: "soviet theme" I think you meant hell march
3:55:14 | Nelson Nicholson: men eating sandviches is very intimidating
3:55:15 | Sam Xiang: This isn't Hell March tho?
3:55:16 | Stolen Comment Corp.: nah this is the siege of berlin
3:55:21 | TFX: RIGGED
3:55:26 | Sam Xiang: This is more like Bagration
3:55:34 | Worm enjoyer2015: Berlin 1945
3:55:35 | Electric Smash: ra ra rasputin 
3:55:42 | Real_Markiplier: This is clearly lore inaccurate, Heavy's family were counter-revolutionaries smh

3:56:09 | GlebGuy: @Real_Markiplier I don't think Russia cares about accurate history
3:56:17 | Sam Xiang: If this is lore inaccurate, how do you explain the fact that Heavy's RED
3:56:27 | Sam Xiang: /j
3:56:32 | Nelson Nicholson: the shounic vtuber model looks devastated to watch this
3:56:49 | BananowyBT: do you like tf2 comics?
3:56:53 | 행hang: Yipee

3:57:15 | GlebGuy: The TF2 comics are an absolute masterpiece
3:57:17 | case: so whos winning
3:57:20 | lostme: aight I'm back, did medics win against soldiers?
3:57:26 | Sam Xiang: No they didn't
3:57:27 | Real_Markiplier: "After 1000 hours of testing, we discovered that 50 Medics cannot beat 50 Soldiers or Heavies"
3:57:53 | mor eknow: why do all community server bhop plugins suck? they sort of stop you momentarily before the next hop
3:57:56 | Worm enjoyer2015: we dont want the mid fight, thank you
3:57:57 | binhbong315: real
3:57:59 | Bubster: you should scramble teams to remove skill factor
3:58:00 | punn: meds only win against spys i guess
3:58:21 | Nelson Nicholson: you should remove skill
3:58:36 | Carlos📗🏆: steiner's counter attack fail blu can't win
3:58:36 | Sam Xiang: I would love to see this with friendly fire but it would be an unworkable mess
3:58:46 | GlebGuy: This might actually be a fair fight
3:58:54 | Worm enjoyer2015: Rare med dub

4:00:04 | Joshua Pinkham: shos always bending his knees
4:00:04 | Le mont: Has Shounic drunk any water yet?
4:00:15 | Sam Xiang: Shounic is dehydrated
4:00:18 | Deranged: Shounic is a bottom 100%
4:00:19 | Nelson Nicholson: shounic is very drunk
4:00:19 | Nessinby: shrimp check
4:00:30 | rendaddy: shounic died from dehydration
4:00:38 | Bobo: Spy vs pyro no balls
4:00:48 | Sam Xiang: He leaves and instantly gets sniped
4:00:48 | Deranged: BAN SHOUNIC
4:00:52 | Robson: damn are any of these actually close?
4:00:57 | mor eknow: I don't know if you read the question or simply don't know but do you know why bhop plugins always suck? how hard is it to just uncap your speed?
4:01:01 | GlebGuy: @Bobo I think that might have already passed, and it's all picked at random
4:01:01 | Sam Xiang: Uhh Pyro vs Engie was pretty close
4:01:02 | Worm enjoyer2015: the sniper main asking youi to drink so he could line up that shot lol
4:01:03 | Nessinby: WAIT
4:01:15 | Nessinby: DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THAT SPY
4:01:26 | BananowyBT: hopefully not any more nosebleeds
4:01:33 | mor eknow: so there's no functional way of doing it right?
4:01:44 | Le mont: I missed a bunch of the stream cause my end of the stream kept on dying out.
4:01:54 | Nelson Nicholson: vat a blood bath
4:01:56 | Inc0m1ng: I keep asking what your favorite match up is but you keep ignoring me >:(
4:01:57 | Le mont: I dunno, anyone have any nice food lately?
4:02:13 | Sam Xiang: I just ate some rice and red-braised ribs I cooked last night
4:02:16 | Real_Markiplier: I'm pretty sure Sniper is the second weakest class in Class Wars, only better than Spy 
4:02:18 | Sam Xiang: It was decen
4:02:18 | Plants10000: shounic do you have the next tf2 update in your disc drive
4:02:21 | Bobo: could you handle a übercharge irl? do it next vid no balls
4:02:22 | GlebGuy: Guys, TF2 is going to be 20 years old *really soon*
4:02:23 | Generic User: Does the client predict VScript think functions?
4:02:24 | Plants10000: please update tf2
4:02:29 | lostme: do you refrigerate bread?
4:02:37 | Le mont: Red braised ribs? Never heard of that.
4:02:43 | Real_Markiplier: But have you downloaded the sigma?
4:02:45 | mor eknow: but there are some videos of uncapped bhop being smooth, is it just a ping thing?
4:02:47 | GlebGuy: @lostme I do. They last much longer and taste the same
4:02:49 | Inc0m1ng: do you teleport bread?
4:03:04 | Sam Xiang: It's a Chinese way of cooking stuff
4:03:06 | GlebGuy: But JUST regular bread, not like pastries and stuff
4:03:06 | Bobo: do you have a secret teleporter in your house that you teleport bread
4:03:22 | Worm enjoyer2015: YOU FELL FOR THAT?
4:03:25 | Sam Xiang: What...does refrigerating bread do
4:03:29 | Pointing Device: pun successfully delivered
4:03:32 | Inc0m1ng: are there benefits to refrigerating bread
4:03:32 | mor eknow: but bread on the fridge sometimes gets wet
4:03:33 | Le mont: Oh it certainly helps.
4:03:34 | Nelson Nicholson: but Sheldon from Big Bang Theory said it doesn't work
4:03:35 | Nessinby: I mean some people swear by it
4:03:36 | mor eknow: it's yucky
4:03:39 | Inc0m1ng: however you spell it cause im dumb
4:03:40 | Real_Markiplier: It gives you cancer
4:03:52 | Sam Xiang: I guess for some people, my stomach doesn't like cold food
4:03:52 | lostme: cold bread, ew
4:03:58 | Nessinby: breathing air gives you cancer
4:04:01 | Inc0m1ng: by cancer you mean tumors
4:04:02 | Bobo: bread is bread, teleport It or no balls :pouting_face::pouting_face::pouting_face:
4:04:03 | BananowyBT: what would you want in a tf2 update
4:04:09 | Le mont: Unfridged bread lasts like 3-4 days before it grows mold. Fridged bread can usually last a week.
4:04:09 | rawr261: lmfao no
4:04:10 | punn: hmmm
4:04:13 | Ozvoid: why?
4:04:15 | punn: interesting
4:04:15 | Le mont: Nah pyro wins.
4:04:23 | mor eknow: have you ever tried bread with honey and cheese i swear it's so good
4:04:26 | GlebGuy: It depends. I predict that if the pyros manage to cover enough ground, the scouts won't have space to run around and evade
4:04:32 | Plants10000: boston gets burned to the ground
4:04:33 | Nessinby: oh no, I think it'll be a spawn camp nightmare. best chance scouts will have is if they all grab FAN
4:04:33 | BananowyBT: sun on the stick for scout
4:04:34 | megascatterbomb: Refrigeration can slow down the staling process, but it’s not ideal for all bread types. Cold temperatures cause the starch to recrystallize, resulting in a stale flavor and texture.
4:04:39 | lostme: sniper and spy currently tied at 0% winrate
4:04:39 | rawr261: they can't kill 50 pyros before they run out of room
4:04:46 | H . A: Pyro has more area damage
4:04:48 | megascatterbomb: there's some chatgpt wisdom on refridgerating bread
4:04:49 | Hax1337: good scouts would win, these aint good scouts
4:04:50 | Le mont: Scorch shot.
4:04:50 | GlebGuy: Yeah most of scouts are dead.
4:05:01 | mor eknow: what's like your favourite weird combination
4:05:04 | mor eknow: of food
4:05:09 | Nelson Nicholson: I looked it up on Google and it doesn't seem that refrigeration for bread is really advisable
4:05:10 | megascatterbomb: shounic wtf is your viewmodel fov
4:05:12 | Shaaaaaaaaawn: the whole spawn room is on fire
4:05:15 | Real_Markiplier: That many pyros can cover the entire middle part of the map in fire 
4:05:16 | BananowyBT: Sun-on-a-Stick gives fire protection
4:05:24 | Funny Man haha: turn on voice chat again
4:05:30 | Inc0m1ng: whats the most illegal thing you own
4:05:38 | Inc0m1ng: lmao
4:05:39 | Matomatic: it's so joever
4:05:43 | Le mont: I don't have one either. Not weird but I love dipping my bread into tomato soup
4:05:43 | Sam Xiang: This avatar
4:05:46 | Nessinby: peanut butter and jelly is a weird combination Ive heard people loke
4:05:46 | GlebGuy: I usually make cous-cous and mix it with jam and peanut butter, boil some eggs, make some easy sandwiches, and maybe mix granules/nuts into the cous-cous again.
4:05:53 | H . A: Time to cook
4:05:54 | Nelson Nicholson: yippee
4:05:58 | Bobo: least spawncamping pyro:
4:06:05 | Ozvoid: NEMO!
4:06:10 | Nelson Nicholson: we should all say yippee in celebration
4:06:24 | Worm enjoyer2015: Pyro is giving birth
4:06:25 | H . A: O-o
4:06:27 | 행hang: Yippee
4:06:28 | BananowyBT: Sun-on-a-Stick gives fire protection for scouts
4:06:39 | Stump: Man I love tf2 voice chat, never change
4:06:42 | Drazel Snake: pyros playing helldivers 2 burnung bugs
4:06:50 | Meligor San: music so syncs in
4:06:52 | Le mont: LOLL
4:06:54 | Mr. Tatortot: what is bro babbling on about
4:06:56 | Le mont: We have to contain the scouts.
4:07:01 | Awful content: screams of the damned
4:07:04 | mor eknow: @GlebGuy that's unhinged, maybe I'll try it
4:07:07 | Real_Markiplier: Once one team gets spawn camped is there any point in playing until the end of the round? It's not like they can do anything at that point
4:07:12 | Sarevock: lmào the scouts don't stànd à chànce
4:07:14 | Nelson Nicholson: they sound like the chocolate guy from SpongeBob at certain points and inflections
4:07:33 | Le mont: 'Just for footage'
4:07:43 | Pointing Device: "entertain me, D class personnel"
4:07:45 | mor eknow: @Sarevock why the weird tildes
4:07:57 | Sam Xiang: Maybe they're French
4:08:01 | Bobo: 114 ping :skull::skull::skull:
4:08:02 | Real_Markiplier: You should use this avatar in your videos 
4:08:06 | BananowyBT: scouts prob could do it but they gave up a bit lol
4:08:08 | punn: more of the "chamber"
4:08:20 | Nessinby: have you had any 'failed' videos, like ones with bad premises or corrupted footage?
4:08:22 | Le mont: See how the mid fight goes
4:08:25 | Inc0m1ng: hey skips....
4:08:31 | bore: >tunes in to shounic stream
4:08:39 | Nelson Nicholson: hey rigby
4:08:40 | bore: >femboy shounic model
4:08:43 | bore: No thanks!
4:08:48 | Petshop: Tbh the dps is too strong
4:08:58 | Le mont: Death
4:09:02 | Nelson Nicholson: rip
4:09:05 | rawr261: aintnoway
4:09:05 | mor eknow: spy is dead
4:09:07 | ButtonMasher: Has Spy won any matchups yet?
4:09:07 | Nelson Nicholson: rip funny frenchman
4:09:09 | mor eknow: is nice
4:09:19 | 행hang: Finally some demo gameplay
4:09:21 | punn: less go time to get spawn camped agin
4:09:21 | Le mont: WAIT HAS SPY vs SNIPER HAPPENED YET
4:09:28 | BananowyBT: another spy hell
4:09:32 | Sam Xiang: No I don't think so
4:09:38 | Jeff Jaf: it's already over 
4:09:40 | TheCeilingIsTalkingToMe: spy vs spy?
4:09:42 | AGY325: Hi Shounic I love you
4:09:50 | Mr. Tatortot: spy and sniper is gonna be the best matchup
4:09:58 | Real_Markiplier: "And my favorite class is the spy"
4:09:59 | Mr. Tatortot: feather weight champion belt
4:10:01 | lostme: @shounic both spy and sniper at 0
4:10:01 | Vopros: go next
4:10:02 | Nelson Nicholson: this is hard to watch
4:10:07 | Carlos📗🏆: if its spy vs spy spy wins
4:10:09 | Inc0m1ng: now that im stuck in chat what do we talk about 
4:10:13 | rawr261: strange farming
4:10:15 | mor eknow: nah smg and jarate will destroy
4:10:18 | H . A: Spy can only win against other spies
4:10:26 | Matomatic:  those poor poor spies
4:10:26 | Sam Xiang: It seems like there's no class vs itself?
4:10:27 | Le mont: What's the most expensive tf2 item you ever had
4:10:28 | punn: demo op pls ban
4:10:29 | jep0rox: this is why I hate koth even on normal casual servers because there's no incentive to stay at the point, it always becomes spawn camping
4:10:32 | Bobo: i will commit crimes agaisnt the fbi
4:10:34 | Nelson Nicholson: not one of ya's gonna survive this
4:10:39 | Real_Markiplier: It seems that in a Britain vs France match-up Britain wins 
4:10:51 | Awful content: Actual purgatory
4:11:01 | Real_Markiplier: Your avatar looks depressed
4:11:07 | Stump: yipeee

4:11:56 | Stump: Challenging work
4:11:56 | I play ksp, lol: spy
4:12:02 | Real_Markiplier: @Nessinby tell me, what's the name of the island Scotland is on?
4:12:03 | Le mont: Someone's gonna want someone dead.
4:12:03 | Inc0m1ng: I love that a meet the team video is more entertaining than chat rn lol
4:12:03 | BananowyBT: have you gotten burned out of this map?
4:12:04 | Sam Xiang: oo
4:12:04 | Stump: Garnuntee you're not go hungry
4:12:05 | SageVarq: shounic reacts to Meet the Sniper? I've been waiting for this moment.
4:12:10 | Sam Xiang: I'm not a crazed gunman dad
4:12:15 | Stump: *Painful demo screams*
4:12:21 | Stump: I'm an ASSASSIN
4:12:21 | Sam Xiang: I think his mate saw me
4:12:25 | Matomatic: at the end of the day if theres 2 people alive someone is gonna want someone dead
4:12:28 | Nelson Nicholson: yes, yes he did
4:12:28 | Stump: Yes, yes he did
4:12:30 | Carlos📗🏆: PISS

4:12:41 | rawr261: sniper vs spy predicted
4:12:44 | Matomatic: look m8
4:12:49 | Stump: blockes who BLUDGEON THEIR WIFE TO DEATH WITH A GOLD TRPGHY
4:12:51 | Sam Xiang: Dad....dad I'm a

4:13:10 | mor eknow: got it
4:13:16 | Matomatic: dad dad, put mum on the phone
4:13:17 | Real_Markiplier: "Dad... Dad I'm not a femboy. I'm a streamer!"
4:13:29 | BananowyBT: have you gotten burned out of this map yet?
4:13:56 | Sam Xiang: Oh here we go
4:13:57 | Le mont: YESSS 
4:13:59 | Le mont: This is it.
4:14:02 | buzzietuzzie: lets goooo
4:14:03 | ButtonMasher: 2009 be like:
4:14:06 | Real_Markiplier: Sniper will stomp
4:14:08 | punn: letsss gooooo
4:14:08 | Mr. Tatortot: peak vs p
4:14:10 | Stump: YOOOO
4:14:13 | dojodog: sniper vs spy, sniper vs spy, everybody wants to see this happen
4:14:14 | Awful content: my money is on sniper
4:14:20 | H . A: Better spy vs spy
4:14:27 | Nelson Nicholson: ayo
4:14:36 | Matomatic: sniper v spy... surely spy wins ... right?
4:14:43 | Voltϟ: oh shounic is a femboy? UwU
4:14:56 | Col. Klink 1965: I think dude found his son Nemo
4:14:57 | Le mont: Chat paid 700$ for him to be a femboi
4:15:03 | Le mont: Femboy not femboy
4:15:09 | Real_Markiplier: It would be a shame if Sniper had a weapon that directly counters Spy's main abilities
4:15:12 | mor eknow:  people can't read apparentlt
4:15:15 | mor eknow: tly*
4:15:31 | Voltϟ: people can't get jokes apparently 
4:15:35 | Sam Xiang: It's okay we support Shounic whether he's a femboy or not
4:15:52 | ButtonMasher: I'm getting a lot of questions already answered by my "I'm not a femboy" shirt
4:16:00 | mor eknow: @Voltϟ I'm not talking about you lol
4:16:02 | mor eknow: it was a joke
4:16:02 | Hexakon: We need a full team of 5000 hour kunai spy main, then spy will win
4:16:10 | Real_Markiplier: Anime avatar, playing on team spy... You ain't beating the femboy allegations
4:16:19 | Can Floph: 700 usd? i don't belive you, funny man
4:16:28 | Pointing Device: @Real_Markiplier yes, but it got its headshot immunity removed
4:16:33 | Petshop: sniper literally has an anti-backstab shield and button that reveals spy
4:16:35 | Le mont: Ask Shounic if you really don't believe me
4:16:49 | Nelson Nicholson: you should disguise as an enemy sniper and you can win
4:16:49 | lostme: sniper has some dps and awful healing, spy has nothing lol
4:16:51 | Le mont: And the text above his femboy head
4:16:58 | Hax1337: spy would win if sniper didnt have jarate
4:17:02 | mor eknow: BUFF THE REVOLVER
4:17:03 | Real_Markiplier: Spy is basically just worse sniper idk why you are surprised 
4:17:10 | I play ksp, lol: mid aim
4:17:11 | Matomatic: if you wait between shots it has less spread
4:17:14 | icecubedd: spy would sniper win if jarate spy
4:17:20 | Dixon Balles: I don't even main spy and I love the revolver
4:17:24 | Le mont: Omg yes dead ringer
4:17:26 | Nessinby: have you put the server ticks back up?
4:17:26 | Bobo: sick trickstab
4:17:29 | Nelson Nicholson: sniper op
4:17:31 | Bobo: hit the atoms
4:17:32 | Le mont: Your normal watch ain't gonna do much here lol
4:17:39 | Matomatic: if sniper didnt have the razorback it might be balanced
4:17:43 | Real_Markiplier: Everything a Spy can do Sniper does better
4:17:51 | megascatterbomb: clicky mouse
4:17:55 | Kaka-Carrot Cake: revolver is not that bad if you have a good aim 
4:18:02 | BananowyBT: it also does depend a bit on the skill of players
4:18:09 | Sam Xiang: I guess it just takes getting used to
4:18:10 | mor eknow: the razorback is practically useless in this scenario
4:18:13 | Ozvoid: You want to know why sniper wins? Well, think about it. Spy short yet high-caliber handgun. Wanna know what sniper has? A bigger knife and a much larger, higher-caliber rifle.
4:18:21 | Bubster: nooo my tf2 crashed
4:18:26 | Hexakon: Try disguising as sniper, no downsides of doing it
4:18:26 | overthegrid: its random spread sucks really bad :(
4:18:29 | Bobo: new zealand vs fr*nch
4:18:30 | Kaka-Carrot Cake: see?
4:18:52 | Inc0m1ng: so the ambassador?
4:18:57 | overthegrid:  IT WOULDNT i dont know why they did it :*(
4:19:02 | jep0rox: so, the amby
4:19:03 | Real_Markiplier: Snipers could just go all Jarate and they would have perma mini crits
4:19:08 | overthegrid: that would be awesome :3
4:19:09 | Bobo: enforcer before nerf
4:19:14 | megascatterbomb: first shot is accurate
4:19:18 | megascatterbomb: on any revolver
4:19:20 | mor eknow: imagine there was a sapper that worked like a sentry magnet so you could sentry jump
4:19:33 | Inc0m1ng: if it has spread then I don't feel it cause it feels like a skill issue when I miss lol
4:19:36 | Kaka-Carrot Cake: revolver has a ideal range and that is kind finicky
4:19:36 | Altaruss'28: idk why they felt the need to add both bullet spread and damage falloff to the same weapon in so many cases
4:19:36 | 행hang: Oh?
4:19:37 | Le mont: Gotta wait like 1 second before it falls off and that might just be enough time to not kill someone
4:19:42 | MyyKana: What HUD you use? It looks nice and simple.
4:19:42 | Le mont: The spread that is
4:19:49 | 행hang: Now we hold
4:19:50 | Nelson Nicholson: but what if you disguised as an enemy sniper and you could fool your opponents and backstab them
4:19:55 | Le mont: He's beginning to believe
4:19:55 | Real_Markiplier: For how much Gabe likes the Spy Valve loves nerfing him
4:19:58 | Sam Xiang: This gameplay is pretty intense
4:20:21 | Inc0m1ng: !surrender 
4:20:30 | mor eknow: valve tf2-wise is practically one dude
4:20:44 | MyyKana: What hud you use? It looks nice.
4:20:45 | Matomatic: lol
4:20:53 | Nelson Nicholson: rip
4:20:57 | BananowyBT: what class you don't enjoy to play the most
4:21:01 | Worm enjoyer2015: GOONhud
4:21:15 | lostme: I already see the video title "spy is the worst class in tf2 as proven by science"
4:21:20 | Metal SONICCC!: How much money to add boobs to your oc?
4:21:29 | The Sangheili: Due to how stairs work in this map, Jarate acts weird
4:21:32 | Nelson Nicholson: that spy was the worst spy proven by science
4:21:33 | Nessinby: milk :3
4:21:42 | Vinny: FEMBOY MILK
4:21:48 | Nelson Nicholson: no
4:21:54 | Sam Xiang: Holy crap

4:21:54 | Vinny: yes
4:21:55 | BananowyBT: sus femboy milk

4:22:54 | Sam Xiang: boyfem
4:23:07 | mor eknow: okay I think we lose this one
4:23:10 | Le mont: We need every man on the point
4:23:12 | lostme: this is the only chance for spy to have a victory, you have to do this
4:23:23 | BananowyBT: what class you don't enjoy to play
4:23:25 | Le mont: Everyone 
4:23:35 | Metal SONICCC!: How much money to get you to be a female oc of you?
4:23:40 | Nelson Nicholson: you should disguise as an enemy spy
4:23:43 | Flesh: tf?
4:23:50 | mor eknow: surprisingly I haven't seen as much piss as I thought
4:24:19 | Solres: How many match up left ?
4:24:21 | Real_Markiplier: French Femboy Spy main
4:24:22 | lostme: for friends

4:25:13 | Trefaran: Vive la France
4:25:27 | BananowyBT: :3
4:25:33 | lostme: it goes back and forth, but it seems that snipers have the initiative
4:25:41 | 행hang: The respawn swarm
4:25:43 | Sam Xiang: Maybe once a team caps, they scatter more
4:25:46 | Nelson Nicholson: I think you mean "mon dieu"
4:25:58 | Inc0m1ng: guys I think we should play the class how it was intended
4:25:59 | Sam Xiang: And that lets the other team gather and cap
4:26:01 | mor eknow: ambassador deadringer and big earner?
4:26:01 | lostme: SACRE BLEUUUU
4:26:05 | Solres: Snipers are supposedly good at defending a point
4:26:09 | Nelson Nicholson: murd
4:26:10 | Rafael silva: shounic vtuber ?
4:26:18 | Ceresjanin: skibidi toilet

4:26:57 | Soup: Heavy vs Engi, who will win the minigunoff
4:26:59 | K. Péter: is this gonna be made into a video?
4:27:01 | 행hang: Heavys are slow so there should be more time to prepare i think
4:27:02 | Sam Xiang: Maybe the real class wars was Shounic vs his server
4:27:03 | Le mont: Engie REALLY needs the set up time, but heavy don't
4:27:09 | H . A: Engies can heal, so they have a slight advantage
4:27:12 | itchylol742: LMAO (2)
4:27:14 | Nelson Nicholson: trolled

4:27:44 | Enginefour: the server hates you, L
4:27:48 | Mr. Tatortot: its joever

4:28:22 | Sam Xiang: Thank you for your sacrifice
4:28:23 | NxthingbutV0id: I gtg anyway
4:28:24 | FreeAndLit: If Shounic has 500 viewers, then I'm one of them.If Shounic has one viewer, then I'm THAT ONE.If Shounic has no viewer, that means I'm dead.
4:28:29 | Ceresjanin: inshallah you will be kicked again in 5 seconds
4:28:30 | Nessinby: there are severs that have vip slots, couldn't you set something up like that?
4:28:34 | Dalboeb 1337: hello

4:28:59 | lostme: spy has yet to play against the soldier and heavy, he's winning those for sure :)
4:29:16 | Nelson Nicholson: looks like 2fort intel room
4:29:16 | BananowyBT: imagine it kills the server for using commands there
4:29:20 | mor eknow: wrangler is meta
4:29:22 | Osama bin Laden: just do fire and manouevre
4:29:30 | Le mont: Oh no.
4:29:43 | Valentin Mihai: oh wow engies are getting bullied
4:30:05 | Sam Xiang: If the Heavies can reduce the Alamo then they have a good chance of winning
4:30:07 | Products for Profits Inc.: noo where did the cat drawing go
4:30:07 | Real_Markiplier: Russian Manpower vs American Industry 
4:30:11 | Le mont: Heavies have quite a lot of sustainabity compared to other classes by themselves
4:30:13 | Udidda: sammich
4:30:14 | Inc0m1ng: "Why aren't they dying" to the largest healthpool in the game
4:30:19 | Le mont: Take 200 damage? Banana/sandwich
4:30:20 | Solres: My guess is that 50 heavy takes too much time to deal with (not in 3min anyway)
4:30:20 | Ceresjanin: brawn beats brain
4:30:22 | Sam Xiang: Sandvich
4:30:27 | Pointing Device: when the 300hp class doesn't suddenly fall over
4:30:30 | itchylol742: wrangler them
4:30:33 | Solres: Eventually engi would win
4:30:40 | Meligor San: Real_Markiplier bruh America has twice more people 
4:30:42 | BananowyBT: maybe engies will do better at the end
4:30:42 | Brandon Maldonado: engi might win if we had a 30 min timer
4:30:43 | Le mont: There's enough heavies to keep applying pressure while others heal up.
4:30:45 | Sam Xiang: Famous last words
4:30:47 | Nelson Nicholson: eventually, engie stopped thinking
4:31:04 | Ceresjanin: go melee them
4:31:04 | Osama bin Laden: heavies are basically mobile sentries
4:31:08 | BananowyBT: you left and engies started loosing
4:31:29 | Real_Markiplier: @Meligor San but in the 60s they had more people and TF2 is set in the 60s
4:31:31 | Le mont: If this match had 30 minutes, engie would get spawn camped for like 20
4:31:39 | Valentin Mihai: yeah its stationary sentries vs mobile sentries xD
4:31:45 | Psychicpie: what if you all spammed short ciruit orbs at them 
4:31:53 | Nessinby: heavies have the DPS and range to fight sentries.
4:32:02 | Ink Man Gmod: Being friendly on the server is hard
4:32:02 | Le mont: CAKE is taking names with the rescue ranger

4:32:20 | Mr. Tatortot: short circuit for AOE ???
4:32:28 | TheCeilingIsTalkingToMe: what's the alamo as a strategy? Just a huge spawn sentry nest?
4:32:35 | Le mont: Yea
4:32:37 | Real_Markiplier: Jumps in front of 3 revved up heavies "Dude why aren't they dying???"
4:32:37 | Lgmrszd: what you gotta build shounic
4:32:38 | Solres: Other engi can upgrade your stuff
4:32:45 | BananowyBT: heavies are their own sentries
4:32:46 | Homosexual I'm: too many heavies boolets
4:32:50 | Lgmrszd: we'll destroy it all
4:33:04 | Nelson Nicholson: this'll defend the point
4:33:30 | Psychicpie: imagine how much piercing aoe dmg just 10 orbs will do, and you're 50 engineers 
4:33:30 | Le mont: I mean
4:33:34 | M-Fern5024: what are the teleporters set up to?
4:33:36 | Le mont: There's not 50 level 3 sentries
4:33:43 | Nessinby: man, that was a killbox
4:33:43 | Real_Markiplier: Some may say that Engies lost because Heavies are stronger, but I think it's all because you suck 
4:33:44 | BananowyBT: the solution is to use more gun
4:34:00 | Inc0m1ng: the engies have resorted to dancing to cope with the lost

4:37:19 | lostme: you couldn't hold the alemo at spawn, no way you're holding the point
4:37:22 | Gavin: not nearly enough time
4:37:25 | Le mont: Holy fuck
4:37:26 | Funny Man haha: @shounic that was only a 6 second head start!!!
4:37:28 | Worm enjoyer2015: 1 minute prep time
4:37:33 | Le mont: That IS the Iron Curtain.
4:37:38 | Mr. Tatortot: engis need more setup time
4:37:42 | punn: russia vs texas 
4:37:51 | Jaden: probably 3
4:37:53 | MHzJr: we need even more time to setup
4:37:53 | Ceresjanin: that's what the kids call epic fail
4:37:54 | SleepyEngi: 4 times for good measure
4:37:54 | Em Stocks: yeah
4:37:56 | Psychicpie: you need several eureka effect engineers to supply enough metal 
4:38:01 | Valentin Mihai: i think its completely faire if you cap the point until you have 30 seconds left, then the heavies can attack
4:38:03 | BananowyBT: you would need to give engies more time
4:38:12 | Real_Markiplier: Slay the heavies for about 6 minutesa
4:38:16 | BananowyBT: play Soldier Theme Tribute to Rick May
4:38:25 | Solres: LMAO

4:40:22 | itchylol742: scout never caps once
4:40:24 | Ceresjanin: white boys vs scottman
4:40:26 | Psychicpie: 3 min setup time with the point capped 
4:40:29 | Solres: scout beats demo, so scouts win right ?....
4:40:29 | BananowyBT: scouts maybe could do it
4:40:39 | Joshua Pinkham: skill issue?
4:40:39 | Ceresjanin: L

4:40:57 | Gavin: theres no way this is gonna be close scout is so bad in 50v50
4:40:57 | BananowyBT: imagine it kills server for using commands there
4:40:58 | Flesh: server crashed /j
4:40:59 | Lundgren: how to play on the server
4:41:11 | Ceresjanin: we hacked u
4:41:23 | mor eknow: do you have any idea why I can only see my sprays? 
4:41:35 | mor eknow: in game

4:41:45 | Osama bin Laden: 600$? shounic wants a new femboy model?

4:41:51 | mor eknow: with sprays allowed
4:41:57 | Le mont: Nah
4:42:08 | Le mont: Shounic wants the 600 for some nice dinner.
4:42:11 | mor eknow: ok
4:42:18 | Hax1337: do you have cl_spraydisabled 0
4:42:21 | BananowyBT: @Lundgren there is a pinned message on the top with IP but it's full
4:42:22 | Robson: get milk
4:42:27 | Ceresjanin: skill issue actual
4:42:29 | K. Péter: would have 50 Uncle Danes won with engi vs heavy?
4:42:39 | Le mont: Ehhhh
4:42:55 | Le mont: Heavies don't need to set up and have massive damage output.
4:43:03 | Le mont: Engies NEED set up time to output as much as 50 heavies
4:43:05 | Psychicpie: explosive classes will probably always win a 50v50 
4:43:24 | Inc0m1ng: heavy has big shlongy so he wins
4:43:58 | BananowyBT: nah I think explosive classes lost a couple times
4:44:23 | Motivated: pretty boy pistol
4:44:27 | Solres: Who won demo v soldiers ?
4:44:28 | Osama bin Laden: 25 demos and 25 scouts might beat 50 demos
4:44:39 | BananowyBT: pretty femboy pistol
4:44:58 | lostme: @Solres demos won 2-1, it was real close all 3 rounds
4:45:20 | BananowyBT: use milk maybe
4:45:24 | Motivated: pretty boys pocket pistol
4:45:25 | Psychicpie: passive healing is just mad milk scouts 
4:45:45 | Le mont: The wave of spam, lord.
4:46:33 | Psychicpie: the pistol is 3 hp per hit. you're hardly going to notice it . the milk is 60% lifesteal for the entire team 
4:46:45 | LoyalDevotee17: the stream is still going on lol
4:46:54 | LoyalDevotee17: maybe I'll actually be Abe to sneak it
4:46:54 | BananowyBT: milk is pretty good it heals more then pistol and u can use primary with it
4:46:57 | LoyalDevotee17: able
4:47:14 | Solres: Would 50 scouts beat 50 demoknights ?
4:47:15 | Le mont: The problem is that scout doesn't have as much AoE damage as demo. Scout can get 3-5 picks in a short frame if he's close and has a window of opportunity. Demo can just do it by barfing pills.
4:47:18 | BananowyBT: get close to demos if they don't use melee
4:47:19 | rawr261: cleaver is pog
4:47:35 | Le mont: Dunno about that @Solres 
4:47:42 | Psychicpie: you're 50 scouts do you really need a finisher more than a full team sustain item? 
4:48:11 | M-Fern5024: tf2 bullet hell simulator ....
4:48:18 | Ozvoid: That's because I DON'T care. Demo won already
4:48:24 | Valentin Mihai: out of everyone shooting at you, why do you focus on the single demoman which is randomly dancing towards the checkpoint
4:48:30 | Le mont: I know how you win this.
4:48:32 | mor eknow: you should remove voice coommand cooldown NOW!
4:48:33 | Le mont: Turn on the Touhuo music

4:49:03 | Col. Klink 1965: Oh yeah autism music
4:49:05 | Le mont: Omg yes
4:49:06 | Ozvoid: Put on the wii sports resort swordplay showdown theme
4:49:15 | Nessinby: bro had the music on draw
4:49:18 | lostme: I am shpeed
4:49:30 | Solres: If all scout suicided on the point they'd eventually win
4:49:36 | Sound Breaker: the tf2 touhou to feta corn pipeline
4:49:58 | SleepyEngi: NO
4:49:59 | Inc0m1ng: sounds like cope
4:50:01 | BananowyBT: almost kinda did it
4:50:01 | Meligor San: noo
4:50:03 | TR094: nope
4:50:12 | Psychicpie: I think scout can win with the milk by outsustaining 
4:50:31 | Osama bin Laden: use your bombs
4:50:42 | lostme: shounic, do I count the extra round?
4:50:51 | Northern Pike: y this shit so laggy
4:51:06 | Inc0m1ng: is this lost?
4:51:12 | Mason Barber: night of nights is appropriate for 50 scouts

6:15:26 | Rishav Barua: Engineer makes a comback.
6:15:27 | GraveMan: med v med would be fun
6:15:27 | excalibur345 7: stop
6:15:27 | linguini15: add more metal packs and engi will be better
6:15:29 | Inc0m1ng: should of given him a year minimum
6:15:33 | Trefaran: Engineer has Batman logic
6:15:36 | Wellen: you shouldve just use sm_freese instead of killl
6:15:38 | werecat: maybe if the engies setup at spawn instead of mid
6:15:38 | Flesh: the map is too open
6:15:38 | MrHappy: demoman?

6:16:18 | Motivated: highlight reel
6:16:23 | Zach Dowsley: go about what
6:16:25 | Zeleven: the whole video is about shounic femb-
6:16:26 | MrHappy: imagine spy v spy would be most funny gameplay
6:16:33 | Col. Klink 1965: Engi vs. Soldier was just Soldier, there were no Engies. They got evaporated.
6:16:35 | GamePlayah: spy has his own rank
6:16:39 | Inc0m1ng: same way you explained the meta when every class had every weapon I would imagine
6:16:46 | jep0rox: tier-list of classes on every gamemode, 1 map to test per gamemode

6:17:11 | pilly nutty: @Golfinho yeah its over
6:17:17 | werecat: I wasn't expecting the pyro to be so good
6:17:20 | Among Us: oh hi shounic
6:17:21 | Zeleven: its jover
6:17:22 | lostme: engi would've been higher if they used the circuit in soldier match up
6:17:31 | Alex Drew: Shounic when pass time maps on the 100 player server?
6:17:31 | Golfinho: its joever
6:17:34 | GraveMan: yea why no femboy vtuber in vids X3
6:17:37 | MrHappy: medics vs medics?
6:17:38 | Inc0m1ng: crowd control I would imagine
6:17:59 | Zeleven: !redostream
6:18:04 | BuuGHuuL: And also what mode it was and the map.
6:18:09 | TheCeilingIsTalkingToMe: pyro because of being jack of all trades?
6:18:15 | Eyjafjallajökull Skjálfandafljót: pyro is just a brick wall that moves at you 
6:18:24 | werecat: without class diversity pyro can dominate with the close range dps
6:18:28 | Flesh: Shounic what if you custom gamemodes next time?
6:18:35 | lostme: it's a 3-way tie then for the second place
6:18:45 | Idostuff: m2
6:18:47 | MrHappy: snipers would dominant each other so easily
6:18:48 | TheCeilingIsTalkingToMe: airblast
6:18:49 | GamePlayah: flare momento
6:18:51 | Inc0m1ng: reflecting destroyed soldiers since none of them ran shotguns
6:18:54 | linguini15: heavy isn't real
6:19:00 | Pompmaker1: airblast
6:19:04 | input-latency: last i heard engie is tippy-top-tier in class wars
6:19:08 | Zeleven: heavy is finally balanced
6:19:13 | Mason Barber: I wasn't there, but did pyro airblast the rocket spam?
6:19:14 | Eyjafjallajökull Skjálfandafljót: m2 exists 
6:19:15 | Flesh: anyways I'ma leave now
6:19:18 | idamoofus: Heavy is the best class, we finally have the answer after two decades
6:19:19 | Flesh: bai 
6:19:20 | MrHappy: know what how about hoovie vs hoovie?
6:19:37 | Zeleven: could hoovies kill?
6:19:39 | Gamer23car: 700 usd??
6:19:45 | TheCeilingIsTalkingToMe: less health than soldier?
6:19:48 | MrHappy: taunt kill
6:19:49 | Aw Man: yeah no regen
6:19:51 | Inc0m1ng: soldier has infinite range while demo doesn't
6:19:52 | werecat: heavy looks at the problem and destroys
6:19:52 | BuuGHuuL: Also you should have included in what mode and the map
6:19:56 | Trefaran: Soldiers have banners, demos don't
6:20:03 | werecat: demo has to setup stickies or be a pipe god
6:20:04 | Pompmaker1: send these results to Great Blue and tell him he's wrong, he's the one who says engie is best
6:20:05 | Among Us: gungame maybe
6:20:21 | Rishav Barua: Medic can heal, that is powerful. The medic vs scout round was funny.
6:20:24 | Zach Dowsley: whats happeing
6:20:25 | Zeleven: ok kids, today's lesson is femb-
6:20:26 | Crazy Bird: you said something about making a new thumbnail earlier in the steam, is that still a thing?

6:21:26 | BuuGHuuL: The prize: the femboy
6:21:31 | Ink Man Gmod: This was for the video? i was just tried be friendly
6:21:55 | TheCeilingIsTalkingToMe: I remember Great Blue also making a class wars tierlist, but that was not for 100 players ofc
6:22:12 | iuri menezes dos santos pereira iuri: ko
6:22:21 | Among Us: :grinning_face:
6:22:37 | Vinny: yeah great blue's one was 12v12 not 50v50

6:24:00 | lostme: and then it's engi > pyro > soldier
6:24:06 | (Verified) Jusu: 2:24 am in finland
6:24:10 | linguini15: how much to put a black square over the word "not"
6:24:11 | lostme: they didn't spam the circuit
6:24:15 | MrHappy: I swear in the end if we choose medic v medic it would be funny as hell
6:24:19 | Jole: engis probably forgot about short circuit lol
6:24:19 | Inc0m1ng: shounic has short term memory lmao
6:24:20 | Rishav Barua: Yes, somehow the short circuit was less effective.
6:24:29 | Aw Man: they had loads of SCs bro
6:24:35 | Aw Man: but somehow its less effective
6:24:44 | dojodog: shounic can you
