26:45 | Tibor: thats what she said

1:41:41 | LucasTF: This is no normal map
1:41:46 | LucasTF: No ordinary map
1:41:47 | Orodan: @shounic, nvm

1:42:33 | magicUFO Show: 404 timer not found

1:45:38 | poopideeshroop: so when are you going to sing it?
1:45:39 | mmmmicrowave: im depressed
1:45:40 | dojodog: i love how everyone asked for it and then immediately regretted it
1:45:43 | thai: shounic when are you going to play typical colors 2
1:45:44 | mmmmicrowave: yay
1:45:46 | Václav Němec: that was epic
1:45:48 | Orodan: u switched to a bad map and gave us Jerma to calm us down? >_>
1:45:51 | Someguywholikesart: I'm not happy shou, not after the map change.
1:45:59 | Bobo: PUT IT OUT :speaking_head::speaking_head::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points:
1:46:07 | rafael: what's your hud?
1:46:11 | come 2 brasil: no i will never be happy again after than uncalled for map changed
1:46:16 | KX2I: blu has like 10 afks
1:46:17 | Alex The Dawg: they can break out of the last map but not this one!?!
1:46:38 | Bobo: shounic cant play jerma fortress 2's hud
1:46:41 | rafael: nvm it's in the description
1:46:50 | Xnery: there are people just staring down the window in blu spawn
1:46:56 | Difegue: has 100player wutville ever been tried 
1:47:41 | Alex The Dawg: vocanlol on repeat
1:48:07 | Bobo: shounic fogot to take his meds :skull::skull::skull::skull:
1:48:14 | Difegue: yeah that's about what I was expecting
1:48:16 | Difegue: shame tho
1:48:16 | Komodovah: hello everybody
1:48:20 | (Moderator) Glaceon XIX: The map seems too wide, red isnt forced to group to checkpoints at blu spawn while bue is
1:48:31 | Alex The Dawg: was Wacky races attempted
1:48:49 | Difegue: 100 PLAYER BALLOON RACE
1:48:56 | Bobo: wacky races now no balls
1:49:04 | FreeAndLit: can u switch back to the previous map
1:49:12 | Alex The Dawg: no balls
1:49:33 | rainbow derpman: can we play the minecraft map next
1:49:36 | Solres: What classes were the most negatively impacted from servers being 100 players ?
1:49:38 | dojodog: favorite burger?
1:49:48 | Bobo: spy
1:50:16 | Alex The Dawg: no the timer did go down, it would get stuck then go down. it has gotten stuck at 6, 4:37, and again at 4:04
1:50:16 | come 2 brasil: YE
1:50:46 | Bobo: "for the time being" blud think he gman :speaking_head::speaking_head::speaking_head::hundred_points::hundred_points::skull::skull::skull:
1:50:56 | Aeron G.: Someone said it might have been the flooding in orange that stopped the timer, since no action would be happening there
1:50:59 | AetherJoe: I just joined, and sorry if this has been asked, but was this map specifically designed for 100 players?
1:51:02 | Juest Zungo: maybe the timer getting stuck was intentional as part of the map gimmicks
1:51:10 | (Moderator) Glaceon XIX: being able to die in your own spawn seems like a questionable move
1:51:30 | Bobo: nah
1:51:45 | (Moderator) Glaceon XIX: the gaps
1:51:50 | AetherJoe: lmao
1:52:08 | Foloan: they removed livers from Minecraft sad
1:52:08 | (Moderator) voosh: mind the gaps
1:52:13 | magicUFO Show: being able to die in your own spawn is :speaking_head: an unforseen consequence
1:52:15 | Shaq-Fu: I got a market garden somehow
1:52:28 | Bobo: "nah i'd play wacky races or i have no balls with my beloved fans on 100 players server because i love them" - shounic
1:52:33 | er1k0v: tef or 2
1:52:48 | AetherJoe: railings on the roof is pretty bad ngl
1:52:49 | Difegue: tf is up with those rails on the roof
1:52:52 | LucasTF: :nerd_face:
1:53:10 | AetherJoe: mfing minecraft ass roof
1:53:50 | Bobo: even the roof is getting railed :downcast_face_with_sweat::downcast_face_with_sweat::downcast_face_with_sweat:
1:53:50 | TheKingOfNachos™: fences on roof
1:53:56 | AetherJoe: fence on da roof
1:54:06 | AetherJoe: for deco
1:54:06 | TheKingOfNachos™: yes
1:54:09 | Xnery: minecraft players always place fences on everything
1:54:10 | The Goose: I invented it
1:54:11 | Orodan: @shounic, fake gamer
1:54:11 | Václav Němec: duh
1:54:13 | mmmmicrowave: you do?
1:54:16 | TheKingOfNachos™: detailing:tm:
1:54:23 | Skeletom: villager house had that
1:54:30 | AetherJoe: god no, not a big minecraft man
1:54:31 | mmmmicrowave: THEY DO????
1:54:38 | Qrani: I been playing minecraft 12 years and I ain't seen that
1:54:40 | AetherJoe: i just like the concept of the aether in general
1:54:46 | Xnery: a balcony like area
1:54:47 | Václav Němec: it makes it feel more detailed than it is
1:54:50 | Skeletom: small villager house
1:54:52 | thai: 100 player minecraft server
1:54:54 | onionmuffins101: The old villages had them
1:55:05 | Orodan: @shounic, if u lose then play 2048?
1:55:08 | LucasTF: I put fences on my roofs
1:55:10 | magicUFO Show: :pleading_face: shounic, can we play koth_2048points_pro_2_a3_final next? 
1:55:13 | Xnery: we are definitely not pulling shounic's leg
1:55:14 | Qrani: I guess the villager house does have it but nobody puts fences on roofs in minecraft especially if they are actually sloped
1:55:24 | Bobo: If u lose play wacky races no balls
1:55:31 | onionmuffins101: it was a 5x5x8 house with fences on top
1:55:35 | Wolver Dëp: hor hor hor
1:55:44 | Haziq: That was the bravest sniper ive seen
1:55:45 | AetherJoe: I saw someone do minecraft in tf2 with vscript, can't remember if it was a shounic vid or not
1:55:46 | dojodog: scramble could work
1:55:52 | Cyberpro123: next map
1:55:59 | Ak: move on, map is boring
1:56:00 | Smash Bandicoot: Where's the crate toss??
1:56:04 | mmmmicrowave: i cant jo
1:56:08 | Jason: de_dust2??
1:56:08 | mmmmicrowave: join
1:56:11 | Xnery: i really liked this map though
1:56:13 | Xnery: sob
1:56:37 | Ceol: I'm an internet people!
1:56:42 | AetherJoe: BRO THEY IN THE FUTURAMA TUBES WTH
1:56:43 | Q: bad data, unbalanced teams
1:56:48 | Bobo: "Nah i'd play wacky races with my beloved fans" - shounic :hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points::hundred_points:
1:56:54 | come 2 brasil: OH SO WE CAN FINISH THIS MAP, BUT THE THE LAST ONE??
1:56:56 | Rivulas: mercs in the hamster tubes
1:57:08 | Smash Bandicoot: Where's the crate toss???
1:57:11 | Qrani: well last time the first blu team got all the way to the end and second blu team couldn't get to first
1:57:48 | Rivulas: hampter
1:57:55 | AetherJoe: MORE MOUSE BITES
1:58:00 | AetherJoe: W medigun name
1:58:09 | Bobo: @Qrani well thats just normal payload gameplay
1:58:13 | AetherJoe: house md reference hell yeah
1:58:15 | Nikkidafox: So shounic I'm sure you've gotten this before but... you seem to have a pretty intimate understanding of how tf2 works. Have you considered, y'know, working for Valve? @shounic 
1:58:52 | Václav Němec: they hire contractors tho
1:59:08 | Bobo: Valve should hire shounic!!!! so we can get wacky races on normal game roster!!!!
1:59:33 | Václav Němec: new janitor position
1:59:40 | AetherJoe: i think that people who don't make games think that valve is the end goal, when it really depends on the person
1:59:45 | LucasTF: Who is faicool?
1:59:49 | TheDegu333: from what ive read it can be a very toxic workplace even
1:59:52 | AetherJoe: I go to school for game dev and I def do NOT want to work at valve
1:59:59 | Orodan: Win a game of 2048 against Valve HR and get an employment
2:00:00 | endarkenedgd: no way engicon 2024 came that quickly? i thought it was in march
2:00:03 | Orodan: This is your chance
2:00:04 | AetherJoe: my dream is to start my own studio
2:00:11 | NoiZ: i love hearing him swear for the first time after watching the vids for a long while
2:00:18 | Bobo: aether studio
2:00:26 | Orodan: Win a game of 2048 aganst Valve HR and get an employment
2:00:26 | Orodan: this
2:00:40 | AetherJoe: that and getting my brother to make music for my games lol
2:00:59 | dojodog: something is fucked up with my game, my hitsounds stopped playing
2:01:08 | Václav Němec: awww
2:01:09 | Rovan: it's almost certainly not the dream environment a lot of people think it is
2:01:12 | Pompmaker1: who's Joe?
2:01:16 | Bobo: thats shounic fault
2:01:16 | Jason: and?
2:01:18 | AetherJoe: bruh
2:01:40 | Sehnsucht: it doesn't sound like a very nice place to work from what I've heard tbh
2:01:50 | Sehnsucht: they seem pretty dysfunctional at times as well
2:01:53 | Bobo: why not?
2:02:10 | Nikkidafox: Ok ok. Hear me out. Step 1: We kidnap Gabe. Step 2: we demand tf2 updates. Step 3: Go to prison for 40 years. Step 4: ???? Step 5: Profit
2:02:17 | AetherJoe: I've heard that they've had some problems regarding harassment, but i could be misremembering so please don't take my word as law
2:02:44 | Bobo: step:4 kidnap nikkidafox
2:03:03 | dojodog: I've been working on and off on different projects and now I've finally decided to focus on one project and get a doc for it up and running
2:03:03 | Václav Němec: hopefully they are not doing SCRAM
2:03:05 | Kinetic Kid: remember Artifact: the Dota card game?
2:03:14 | endarkenedgd: idk how/if ppl think getting a 128 is hard, i've just spammed for several games and basically every time i've seen a 128 or two pop up at the game over screen
2:03:45 | Rovan: honestly I'm surprised steam is still working as well as it seems to be
2:03:53 | Jason: ive heard gabe is an actual n*zi, but i could be misremembering so please dont take my word as law
2:03:55 | AetherJoe: the problem with valve games is i think they're a bit too successful for their own good, in the sense that they are expected to be maintained for YEARS and that gets draining for any dev
2:04:03 | Miroslav Miroljubić: So, how's it going?
2:04:04 | KritzKast: This is why converting TF2 to S2 makes sense for Valve to do. TF2 is the only game they maintain that isn't currently on Source 2. 
2:04:21 | mmmmicrowave: insane
2:04:21 | AetherJoe: tf2 is the most obvious example, but all of CS2 is built on CSGO and that was maintained for many years
2:04:24 | Václav Němec: dispenser pick
2:04:36 | Difegue: "maintain" 
2:04:59 | AetherJoe: real
2:05:18 | Bobo: bye maintain you mean update the files
2:05:28 | Snow Doggo: @shounic ass or tits?
2:05:42 | Miroslav Miroljubić: Damn,there was a second of very scary lag.
2:05:52 | mossfan1: and keep servers running
2:05:57 | AetherJoe: well just keep it in a playable state i think
2:05:58 | The Goose: sadly they are pretty good at it
2:06:17 | AetherJoe: maintain can mean a bunch of things for different companies
2:07:04 | AetherJoe: this is a bit of a stretch, but the people who make candy crush maintain it by adding new levels, tf2 was maintained with new maps and weapons and whatnot, and some companies just keep the servers up
2:07:08 | Xnery: ohshit
2:07:20 | AetherJoe: it really depends on the project and the people behind it
2:07:29 | Xnery: are you running the plugin where it removes dusts ropes and shit
2:07:47 | LucasTF: Blu can't coordinate. Can't believe it. 100 people team is easy.
2:08:48 | Shaq-Fu: the problem is youre gay
2:08:52 | AetherJoe: i think i know, but i haven't played so take it with a side of salt
2:09:13 | AetherJoe: I think last is a bit too open and gives RED too many angles to spam and hide
2:09:18 | movE: was that a spray?
2:09:34 | Jason: we need a tf2 MOBILE GAME
2:09:46 | Jason: u guys have phones rite?
2:09:52 | LucasTF: Candy Crush crossover with 2048
2:09:57 | AetherJoe: it's well designed tho, appearance wise
2:10:05 | LucasTF: 2048 is trademarked now
2:10:25 | AetherJoe: like that lol
2:11:05 | AetherJoe: i meant last point, i like the rocket and all the electrical bits
2:11:05 | Joe Bonk: there isn't much variation in the colors it seems . everything is redwood, like everything
2:11:05 | Foxo: ive only ever played this map during engineer fortress and youre pretty much having the same experience
2:11:25 | Rovan: where'd the tube gimmick go 
2:11:38 | mmmmicrowave: i ate it
2:11:50 | Rovan: :(
2:11:56 | rainbow derpman: this map sucks
2:11:56 | mmmmicrowave: hihihha
2:12:01 | thekingmrturtle: bad map
2:12:02 | Lucythelucy: fr
2:12:02 | Ak: it's impossible to cap last on payload with 100
2:12:03 | DeerBoy1940: I was friendly half the game
2:12:08 | rix xir: your trenches server is awesome
2:12:09 | DeerBoy1940: that was fun
2:12:14 | Someguywholikesart: Can we go back to the funny map?
2:12:17 | Nick S: didnt blue win this map once
2:12:29 | Rainbowgamer: hope the map turns out good :thumbs_up:
2:12:35 | Xnery: you're incapable of being nice
2:12:43 | come 2 brasil: map change crashed my game
2:12:48 | dojodog: throw money into the trench your wishes will come true
2:12:50 | AetherJoe: i wonder how 100 player VSH would be, with the right map of course
2:12:59 | rix xir: my gt730 can barely handle the game
2:13:01 | Xnery: even saying compliments sound sarcastic
2:13:03 | mmmmicrowave: can we join again after being kicked for being inactive
2:13:20 | mmmmicrowave: i cant
2:13:35 | AetherJoe: why is there a child in a bucket
2:13:39 | Ak: they're about to get perma spawncamped
2:14:03 | LucasTF: Shounic looking at the sprays and writing people's name on his "Ban note" for later
2:14:28 | Moothebar: what made you want to become vtuber?
2:14:44 | Orodan: @shounic, I have to go. Bye~
2:14:50 | Václav Němec: he is a vtuber
2:14:51 | LucasTF: He is a pngtuber
2:14:52 | Titant: shounic is a pngtuber
2:15:04 | Titant: you're a pngtuber though
2:15:07 | mmmmicrowave: 200 views :D
2:15:07 | dojodog: for fun (:
2:15:13 | AetherJoe: why are people saying my name in tf2 chat
2:15:14 | FreeAndLit: are u a furry ?
2:15:15 | Xnery: furry pngtuber
2:15:17 | AetherJoe: i'm not even in game
2:15:19 | Jack: why does this map have the characters for suijin
2:15:32 | dojodog: i remember the facecam days
2:15:49 | Chaiwat K.: cool
2:15:51 | Václav Němec: cute!
2:15:51 | mmmmicrowave: funy
2:15:59 | Xnery: wheres the twerk
2:16:05 | thai: shocat canonically has some fat cheeks
2:16:09 | senpai duck: it have thicc butt
2:16:14 | Auzzie: give em a 6 pack
2:16:15 | dkz: anyone know the map's name with 8 control points
2:16:28 | Pompmaker1: I always pronounce your name as though it rhymes with "sonic"
2:17:08 | Václav Němec: thick
2:17:38 | AetherJoe: I'm just waiting for the kritz of the sentry where a demo goes on like a 30 player ks with 8 stickies
2:17:39 | Status Gaming: 2048
2:17:42 | LucasTF: Scorch shot is balanced??????
2:17:43 | DeerBoy1940: you are a furry
2:17:43 | Foxo: is a hotdog a sandwich
2:17:50 | AetherJoe: century*
2:17:52 | dojodog: minty
2:17:53 | terry muse: so how about the Palestinian situation
2:17:55 | Boxyt: Mint toothpaste > all but strawberry is also good
2:17:57 | senpai duck: minty 
2:17:57 | Nico St-Pierre: Colgate vs crest
2:17:58 | LeMeow: edible ones
2:17:58 | Ak: what happens if you queue 2fort
2:18:03 | MadTwist: "Is My Little Pony a good show"
2:18:04 | Q: chesseburgers suck
2:18:05 | Dr.kangas: BAKING SODA
2:18:06 | LucasTF: What about the clone attack on the wookies?
2:18:07 | AetherJoe: anything approved by the ADA
2:18:09 | Václav Němec: there are other toothpaste flavors?
2:18:12 | Kinetic Kid: What are yall's top 2 picks for US president?
2:18:14 | Allumi: fuck mint toothpaste, shit burns my mouth
2:18:20 | Ihxlex: wanna talk about the world wars
2:18:23 | mmmmicrowave: yum
2:18:24 | lostme: I am an adult, flavourless. (or strawberry)
2:18:28 | Shaq-Fu: Shounic hates palestine confirmes
2:18:28 | Boxyt: if you're disabled enough every toothpaste is edible
2:18:33 | RatsInYourWalls: weak
2:18:34 | Jack: this map needs better labeling there's just a giant あ to represent the A point painted on the wall
2:18:36 | Moothebar: argue about which TF2 merc should be president

2:28:30 | Q: these tests are my first time
2:28:33 | firechaos70: hi again
2:28:38 | Nico St-Pierre: did the item server mishap make 100 players a smoother experience?
2:28:40 | LucasTF: Does Shounic know what a trench is?
2:28:43 | Jaden: sometimes
2:28:49 | Hectictude: Did you know they put literal-ass sewer juice on their food and call it spice?
2:28:49 | Allumi: the streams are a good way to get the feel of 100 player tf2
2:28:50 | Jole: can't believe i have an impersonator
2:28:51 | RatsInYourWalls: Shounic is throwing the game
2:28:55 | Xnery: havent tried it
2:29:00 | come 2 brasil: yes, i play casual while queued to joined trenches
2:29:06 | Keegan Kopas: 100 player tf2 but with 5 saxton hales
2:29:31 | come 2 brasil: IT NEEDS badmap_v143
2:29:33 | just Lenya:  More stupid maps
2:29:34 | MadTwist: Yes yes yes way more maps
2:29:39 | Inc0m1ng: I think it needs less vanilla maps and more custom maps like this
2:29:41 | Xnery: i think you need to remove all 5cp and koth maps
2:29:41 | AetherJoe: i have no comment, haven't played 100 player yet
2:29:46 | DeerBoy1940: I have to go, I need to sleep, y'all have fun
2:29:47 | terry muse: you should add the engineer counter strike map to the server but only 1 minute timer
2:29:48 | Cheeki Breeki: remove dustbowl
2:29:50 | AetherJoe: is there space in the server rn?
2:29:50 | Someguywholikesart: We should add the funny bad map to the map pool.
2:29:52 | MadTwist: Anything other than Upward and Turbine all the damn time
2:29:52 | Foxo: the map pool is fine but there are some dead maps in there, maps that nobody vote for or nominate
2:29:56 | Lovecraft Gaming: add convoy
2:29:56 | Jole: playing dbz was very refreshing so i think more new maps would be great
2:30:03 | Xnery: none of the koth and 5cp maps are good
2:30:09 | lostme: something something degroot rats
2:30:16 | AetherJoe: joining now, ill give it a try
2:30:30 | The Goose: yooo shenmue
2:30:35 | AetherJoe: im a scout main but i have a theory that scout is pretty bad in 50v50 lol
2:30:48 | LucasTF: Casual needs to enable more mods back again.
2:30:54 | Foxo: mostly halloween maps get rarely played aside from perks or crasher
2:30:56 | FreeAndLit: people play the same 8 maps
2:31:05 | MadTwist: Have we done trainsawlaser yet
2:31:12 | LucasTF: Having to preload stuff to use mods is toopid
2:31:23 | firechaos70: it's easy to cheat some achievments here
2:31:43 | AetherJoe: how long does it take to load into the 100 player server for you guys?
2:31:44 | Pompmaker1: yooooo rare patchouli knowledge fumo
2:31:46 | MadTwist: Oh, also maybe prevent repeat maps from being selected at for at least four-ish rounds
2:31:52 | Keegan Kopas: 100 player tf2 but everybody is scout and has every button unbound except for the dispenser voiceline
2:32:03 | Xnery: i hate this map
2:32:15 | Someguywholikesart: The funny bad map was better.

2:32:38 | Hayyan: whats the server ip? I don't have a discord and dont wanna make one 
2:32:39 | AetherJoe: oh he whipped out the buddy
2:32:45 | LucasTF: I don't know if it is a hot take, but Shounic's hud is ugly
2:32:48 | AetherJoe: pinned comment
2:33:03 | Foxo: it still feels like turbine gets played every 3 maps
2:33:04 | Lucythelucy: @Hayyan its the pineed one
2:33:07 | dojodog: i switched back to default a bit ago
2:33:19 | Xnery: is it feasible to put alternates of the played map on cooldown
2:33:24 | Jole: are you still considering removing duplicate maps? (doublecross, turbine)
2:33:30 | oogabogga42: opinion on americans
2:33:48 | Keegan Kopas: opinion on opinions? 
2:33:57 | LucasTF: My allegiance is to the republic. TO DEMOCRACY!!

2:34:35 | Václav Němec: I love to be european
2:34:37 | InsecureBroccoli: which americans? there are like 300 million of them
2:34:38 | June: I could beat the average American at rock paper scissors 
2:34:43 | Titant: most problems come from america
2:34:55 | Jole: without americans we wouldn't have trenches
2:34:58 | oogabogga42: and they very ignorant 
2:34:58 | Keegan Kopas: there is only one american and hes named timmy
2:35:04 | LucasTF: America is the most likely country to become an utopia, if an utopia is in our realm of possibiity

2:36:32 | Nico St-Pierre: china

2:36:45 | Titant: it's a fact as far as I know
2:36:56 | Hubert Swie: chian usses kids in factories so ofc they meak less pollution
2:36:59 | lostme: the only american I like is darinsky, because he rolled to be my friend and got a 'yes'
2:37:02 | AetherJoe: to say that any one country is purely responsible is inaccurate and misleading. To say it is no countries fault is bad too
2:37:06 | Jaden: can you get fatmagic on the trenches
2:37:12 | LucasTF: I am proud of being american! (I am from South America)
2:37:16 | LucasTF: lol

2:37:46 | AetherJoe: it's better to say that we are all responsible in some way and that environmental protection is an effort that all of us that a conscious of it have to consider
2:37:48 | Hubert Swie: helt care
2:37:52 | Jole: idk man i enjoy the 38% tax floor
2:37:55 | Joshua Pinkham: the problem with this map is that one team has to steamroll or else it's a stalemate
2:37:58 | Nico St-Pierre: you have to pay taxes even if you dont live in the usa
2:37:58 | Keegan Kopas: it's wack, and they don't tell you how many taxes you have to pay either, you have to figure out yourself
2:38:03 | just Lenya: Would live in america any day of the week
2:38:10 | Hubert Swie: nah

2:38:52 | lostme: europe at least doesn't dump it all into military
2:39:07 | Hubert Swie: we dump it all into Economy

2:39:36 | RatsInYourWalls: me thinks
2:39:37 | Nico St-Pierre: technically there are free tools that tell you how much you owe, but it's suppressed by private companies
2:39:50 | Hubert Swie: its cool
2:39:56 | Buttered Egg: i dont play tf2 too often but your silly cat avatar is so cool so i joined your 100 player server and im rlly getting into tf2 now
2:40:03 | Xnery: their family
2:40:04 | EdgeOfDivinity: The mickey mouse law
2:40:09 | dojodog: If I died i'd want my IPs to go public
2:40:17 | Václav Němec: doesn't the publisher own the copyright?
2:40:33 | EdgeOfDivinity: Cause the family would still like roayalties I guess
2:40:43 | Keegan Kopas: I'm in favor of no copyright law once you take into account things outside of the creative fields. Patents shouldn't exist, just look at insulin 
2:40:48 | lostme: the big mouse likes money so we can't have nice things
2:40:48 | EdgeOfDivinity: But then Disney was like NO, WE WANT MORE
2:41:03 | firechaos70: watch out for arrow spam
2:41:29 | Kalinka: sho stop playing demo its boring
2:41:34 | jaymae999: if we have no copy right there is no reason to reserch and make new things
2:41:35 | Keegan Kopas: tell that to the dude who invented farming
2:41:35 | dojodog: copyright exists because people invevitably will misuse things that dont belong to them
2:41:44 | Nico St-Pierre: funny tf2 stream, meanwhile chat is talking about taxation and individual rights and ownership of works
2:41:48 | Václav Němec: why? to make the world a better place ofc xd
2:41:49 | lostme: the guy who invented insulin sold the patent for 1$ bruh
2:41:51 | StaryPlays10: whould you: eat a hampter for 1b dollars or be good at tf2
2:41:51 | come 2 brasil: bro the reward is helping humanity
2:41:52 | June: Didn’t the people who made insulin made the patent free? 
2:41:57 | Keegan Kopas: the dude who invented synthetic insulin deliberately didnt patent insulin, the patent holder of synthetic insulin was not the inventor
2:42:02 | Kalinka: insulin wasnt invented
2:42:08 | Titant: copyright was originally 14 years + 14 more if you remember to extend in time. That was made so that you got the money for your creation but not your ancestors
2:42:40 | Despresso: Without patents, somebody could copy iPhone to a tee, even down to code.
2:43:28 | Xnery: you wanted an argument 
2:43:31 | just Lenya: This map sucks

2:44:07 | Xnery: there is hope for pl_dustbowl 
2:44:31 | Xnery: it's just 5cp with extra steps
2:44:33 | Lovecraft Gaming: tbh that wasnt bad

2:44:57 | Xnery: rocketravine was fine though
2:44:58 | Lovecraft Gaming: unironically the football field was the best because it ahd so much open space, 100 players needs space
2:44:59 | Xnery: daytrip sucks

2:46:06 | Ak: 100 vsh
2:46:07 | ToFally: play cp_longhalls

3:39:46 | Grogcito: at least compared to all the other monstrosities you've made us play
3:39:49 | Václav Němec: it might be obvious, but why don't you like pass time?
3:39:49 | cav: its not impenetrable
3:40:08 | Doctor Sandvich: trainsawlaser pls

3:41:31 | just Lenya:  I have a cat it says "bark"
3:41:38 | (Verified) SolarLight: pass time engi issue is just due to people stacking scouts like morons
3:41:44 | LucasTF: They cancelled the whole franchise
3:41:48 | cav: shounic killed goku

3:42:11 | (Verified) SolarLight: scout is just easier
3:42:14 | Grogcito: I prefer LED light tbh
3:42:19 | Difegue: mannpower is better don't @ me
3:42:21 | Me: map design will always be one of the hardest things
3:42:25 | RatsInYourWalls: make a passtime map, but all the info_player_teamspawns have the scout checkbox unticked
3:42:26 | Mr.Kleiner: @shounic u whine like a 7yr old tiny little eeppy beeppy gurl

3:44:08 | Hugh Neutron: I mean its still better than junction or turbine hah
3:44:13 | A guy ?: Imo, maps for 100 players need to be made for the nine classes. Normal maps don't think with the same theoretical mindset.

3:46:25 | Xnery: shounic is a true gundam fan
3:46:28 | lostme: aw(
3:46:30 | RatsInYourWalls: you know what actually kills people? Freddy Fazbear’s pizza. because if you go to FNAF freddy five bears, pizzeria, you, get the bite of ‘87, cause Freddy Fazbear goes, “Or, or or or, or or or or or o
3:46:39 | Inc0m1ng: it all comes tumbling down..
3:46:52 | Xnery: everyone's mood is awful

3:48:00 | Stolen Comment Corp.: put developer commentary maps
3:48:02 | Kalinka: what does shounic mean
3:48:13 | Pompmaker1: CUM, SUSSY TODD
3:48:14 | dojodog: they're gonna hafta glue you
3:48:19 | magicUFO Show: MA:78 we worked together
3:48:35 | Xnery: you need to give the maps another shot
3:48:42 | Xnery: the teams are horribly unbalanced
3:48:50 | firechaos70: it's the teams
3:48:53 | Allumi: if you we're forced to add one of the maps which ibe would it be?
3:48:54 | LucasTF: Do you know what pyro's favorite food is?
3:48:56 | Corn Beverly: Wow, that's different from how literally everyone else I know pronounces it. Nice to have some confirmation they weren't right just by majority
3:48:57 | Rhino: so many explosions and projectiles that shit will give you ptsd
3:48:58 | cav: what shounic doesn't know is that all the default maps is just Rate Your Favourite Chokepoint
3:49:00 | armygamelover: The autobalancer you have is simply terrible
3:49:03 | terry muse: sounds like it's just a skill issue
3:49:08 | RatsInYourWalls: its never a team issue
3:49:11 | RatsInYourWalls: always a map issue
3:49:13 | Xnery: there are worse maps in the trench map pool
3:49:14 | RatsInYourWalls: remember that gamers
3:49:31 | nah: Where you from shounic
3:49:33 | firechaos70: goku is on your team
3:49:33 | cav: usually the determiner is how many people are afk in spawn
3:49:37 | thelostrune: I'd say release them into rotation and poll which ones people wanna keep, but I'm no trenches regular
3:49:44 | armygamelover: <3
3:49:54 | cav: people are taking 100player too seriously lmao
3:49:55 | just Lenya: Lets do a vote to decide if map is good or not
3:50:17 | LucasTF: Do you know why the 3rd class got a bunch of money? Because they were on the PYRO
3:50:21 | Pompmaker1: I always pronounce your name as though it rhymes with "sonic"
3:50:25 | dojodog: man I wish there were good maps to play on trenches"
3:50:27 | Corn Beverly: how many would vote seriously though
3:50:30 | dojodog: megacrazycar:
3:50:41 | Mr.Kleiner: @shounic bro this map is fire wtf
3:50:41 | MA:78: The map reviewer has been summoned
3:51:22 | firechaos70: do you count when you load the beggars?
3:51:23 | just Lenya: 1 point is a skill check
3:51:31 | Xnery: people need to account for map knowledge too
3:51:49 | LucasTF: A map that is actually a trench, you can only go forward or backwards
3:52:34 | Corn Beverly: so a corridor...?
3:52:36 | cav: oh yeah what about the tug of war payload map
3:52:46 | cav: WASTE REMASTER
3:52:52 | LucasTF: A very long one
3:53:13 | Václav Němec: T______T
3:53:19 | Difegue: it's time
3:53:19 | cav: socer
3:53:20 | Xnery: rocketravine and mesaworks is good though....

3:53:25 | Grogcito: it's time for soccer
3:53:26 | mmmmicrowave: not again
3:53:26 | Corn Beverly: yay!
3:53:26 | magicUFO Show: let's play 2048
3:53:28 | just Lenya: The maps that everybody liked are bad and maps that nobody liked are good
3:53:30 | LucasTF: You have been playing demo the whole stream?
3:53:30 | cav: youve only been playing for 7 straight hours
3:53:34 | Stolen Comment Corp.: put us in developer commentary maps
3:53:43 | mmmmicrowave: hooray!
3:53:45 | Atf2: pain
3:53:45 | Venom Snake: TF2 anonymous
3:53:49 | armygamelover: Is it a map problem then?
3:53:52 | Taureon: the best map in the game
3:53:55 | dojodog: shounic's mental breakdown
3:53:58 | 3slimy5me: cryin in the club
3:53:59 | thekingmrturtle: fun map
3:54:00 | dojodog: the downfall
3:54:00 | MA:78: The map reviewer has spoken
3:54:01 | Inc0m1ng: we should do VIP instead of tf2go lmao
3:54:01 | Allumi: its so jover
3:54:03 | Ak: what are the server specs?
3:54:05 | MA:78: that last map sucks
3:54:05 | Václav Němec: 100 player dodgeball?
3:54:23 | armygamelover: It didn't crash on the MvM one cause you switched map before it ended
3:54:26 | Venom Snake: maybe it's the game mode problem, like it's meant to switch to another map
3:54:30 | igorka5. exe: the concheror is broken in my opinion 
3:54:31 | MA:78: 100 player dodgeball would be chaos
3:54:31 | oogabogga42: it after the game ends
3:54:36 | magicUFO Show: if there are any mappers in the chat, is it possible to create a 2048 map in TF2? the team that gets to 2048 first wins
3:54:44 | MA:78: Like saying that itemtest is payload
3:54:48 | Atf2: it's as if tf2's spaghetti wasn't designed for 100 players
3:54:56 | MA:78: Team Fortress Global Offensive best comp experience
3:54:57 | LucasTF: I wanted to play itemtest
3:55:12 | nah: I miss old csgo
3:55:39 | LucasTF: I will break your trust further, but let's add itemtest to the server rotation
3:56:07 | Kyler Surrey: what the hell did I just tune into
3:56:12 | mmmmicrowave: WHAT
3:56:19 | Xnery: bad timing to jump to cs
3:56:22 | mmmmicrowave: WHAT THE YOU MEAN CS IS A BETTER GAME
3:56:41 | igorka5. exe: its so laggy and broken
3:56:44 | igorka5. exe: oh my god

3:56:53 | Inc0m1ng: VIP hunted im telling you lmao
3:57:00 | igorka5. exe: it's perfect
3:57:10 | Pompmaker1: you should put x10 on the server
3:57:17 | cav: number of tf2 players: measly 76000 sniper bots
3:57:23 | Doctor Sandvich: PERFERCT
3:57:26 | Mr.Kleiner: this shit is so laggy wtf

3:59:47 | Xnery: and demotes the victim
3:59:51 | Inc0m1ng: yes
4:00:47 | missing.trigger: "shounic plays gun game for a first time"
4:01:19 | Taureon: how hellish would this map be if everyone was a kunai spy
4:01:43 | Xnery: the awp one shots on body shot you didnt need to aim for the head lol
4:02:08 | Inc0m1ng: didn't crash after 2 rounds

4:02:59 | Václav Němec: maybe the cart creates debris when it explodes which is added to entity list?
4:03:15 | Mr.Kleiner: For whatever reason this map reminds me of flash games and this is good
4:03:18 | magicUFO Show: the bloody cart's not moving!
4:03:28 | itchylol742: ping everyone
4:03:36 | Xnery: people are dling the map
4:03:38 | Xnery: give them time lol

4:20:24 | Me: mood
4:20:29 | Xnery: take a break
4:20:37 | Inc0m1ng: for the video or the stream?
4:20:52 | lostme: you can try sending a message in #updates without a ping
4:20:55 | Xnery: take a break means you take a break and return to it later
4:21:11 | OblivionCreator: What if we add trade_plaza instead
4:21:27 | Frost: be more lenient with maps and let the trenches decide if it's irredeemable. does it have to be perfect to go to them?
4:21:36 | Evan Stevens: What server is
4:21:45 | Evan Stevens: What server is this?
4:22:13 | Frost: i would have to be playing to get the same vibes I guess
4:22:58 | firechaos70: what other games do you like?
4:22:58 | Frost: actually genius, get YouTube on this
4:23:39 | Frost: if you stream in 8 hours I will be gaming :))))

4:24:28 | Frost: I get off work at 10 :(
4:25:50 | Frost: do a 24 hour stream and watch metrics
4:26:03 | Pinky BowTie: it's the third time youtube unsubs me from your channel ??
4:26:16 | OblivionCreator: Shounic Sleeping ASMR
4:26:32 | Pompmaker1: Hey shounic, what if I drew you as a cute anime catgirl
4:26:38 | missing.trigger: WEAK
4:27:07 | lostme: hey, I did that first
4:27:13 | Václav Němec: catboy
4:27:17 | come 2 brasil: verry common
4:27:21 | cav: shoucat with a bow
4:27:33 | firechaos70: why a cat for your channel?
4:27:41 | Xnery: blu has 8 snipers
4:27:45 | igorka5. exe: BANNANA
4:27:56 | Evan Stevens: Yes
4:28:12 | Xnery: what's the difference between this cactus canyon aside from maybe artpass
4:28:40 | Xnery: oh thats cool
4:29:08 | Pompmaker1: I drew the anime catgirl shounic and posted it in your discord
4:29:13 | Pompmaker1: it is done
4:30:00 | Xnery: 3080480772
4:30:08 | Xnery: i cant find the form lol
4:30:13 | Alfred: I really like the tug-o-war payload maps, but I-m not sure if they would work with 100 players
4:30:44 | Xnery: waste is just 5cp with extra steps
4:31:02 | OblivionCreator: I wonder if we'll ever see the item limit bumped up to 4096 or higher
4:31:06 | Pompmaker1: I posted the drawing in #general
4:31:35 | Václav Němec: wtf cute
4:31:41 | Pompmaker1: programmer socks
4:31:41 | Xnery: those are gamer socks
4:31:42 | RatsInYourWalls: :buffering:
4:31:43 | Václav Němec: programming socks
4:31:50 | Evan Stevens: Yeah, it would be
4:32:01 | Xnery: not me because im not a gamer sadly
4:32:03 | come 2 brasil: not gamer, PProgrammer 
4:32:04 | OblivionCreator: i always wear 3 pairs of gamer socks at the same time
4:32:05 | Pompmaker1: we're not programmers
4:32:05 | Scrumby & Plumbo: They’re programmer socks 
4:32:06 | Alkan: oh now our opinion matters?
4:32:07 | Václav Němec: they are good for blood flow
4:32:11 | lostme: '10 minute doodle' wth
4:32:25 | Allumi: i got a pair, im just closeted and don't wanna wear them rn
4:32:31 | Inc0m1ng: do you think territorial control or domination could work for 100 player?
4:32:33 | Lovecraft Gaming: dude doesnt wear pants
4:32:58 | igorka5. exe: it doesn't, it's all femboy propaganda
4:33:01 | firechaos70: this map isn't too bad
4:33:03 | OblivionCreator: I'm surprised we still haven't got any major 100 player gamemodes made with vscript yet
4:33:40 | Kalinka: try 5 cp
4:34:30 | Alfredo: battle royale?
4:34:44 | Xnery: red just sucks
4:34:45 | Lovecraft Gaming: 4 players 96 zombie bots or 10 players 90 robots
4:34:48 | OblivionCreator: I think a 50v50 arena-lite gamemode would be kind of neat for 100 players but I'm not smart enough to know how it'd work
4:35:04 | (Verified) SolarLight: battlefield gamemode
4:35:28 | firechaos70: why do you have a cat for your pfp?
4:35:33 | Xnery: were gonna keep on getting jumpscared on the anime girl arent we
4:35:35 | Csongor Kovács: add battlefield mode now
4:35:43 | Pompmaker1: 100 player payloadrace when
4:35:48 | Václav Němec: why are you so obsessed with pl and ad? xd
4:35:52 | Xnery: ahhh!!!
4:35:55 | Isitha: cringe
4:35:55 | Aeron G.: cute
4:36:03 | Alkan: you should do the catboy jumpscare when chat misbehaves
4:36:05 | igorka5. exe: kill
4:36:06 | (Verified) SolarLight: merge every gametype into one
4:36:21 | OblivionCreator: I guess my thoughts should probably be more like
4:36:33 | OblivionCreator: I would say CS players are obsessed with defuse yes
4:36:46 | Lovecraft Gaming: this game was made for eternal CTF like god intended
4:36:52 | Xnery: is there anything different here
4:36:54 | Pompmaker1: what does a 100 player KOTH look like I haven't actually seen
4:37:06 | Václav Němec: cs is boring for me tho
4:37:07 | Xnery: layout i mean lol
4:37:58 | RatsInYourWalls: yeah
4:38:02 | Lovecraft Gaming: vehicles would be interesting to see but just not possible with the game's awful janky engine
4:38:02 | RatsInYourWalls: its 1 stage now
4:38:24 | someone's account : yooo it's team fort second
4:38:25 | OblivionCreator: wait have you tried 100 player balloon race
4:38:56 | Pompmaker1: imagine putting koth_deezmocracy on the 100 player server
4:39:14 | OblivionCreator: One of my favourite maps is ctf_convoy and it forever upsets me that nobody ever plays it. I don't even think it plays all that well i just think it's super cool
4:39:30 | Diego Hernandez: Dday map for the 100 player server pls!!!!
4:39:34 | Lovecraft Gaming: ctf_convoy is the goat
4:39:44 | firechaos70: based on that video were you talked about the neutral team, would you try a server for that?
4:39:51 | brazilian gamer: retard
4:40:12 | RatsInYourWalls: why though
4:40:15 | RatsInYourWalls: whats the point
4:40:17 | Doctor Sandvich: gungame was really fun
4:40:30 | The Goose: 2048
4:40:34 | OblivionCreator: i think the thought is having a 3 team tf2 gamemode but I don't think it would work, instinctively
4:41:24 | Inc0m1ng: 4 team already exists in tf2c but I wish there was a way to port it in vanilla tf2
4:41:30 | OblivionCreator: we have tf2c at home. tf2c at home: (broken-ass 3 team gamemode)
4:42:10 | Lovecraft Gaming: tf2c doesnt have any populated 100 player 4 team servers tho
4:42:22 | igorka5. exe: gungame was brocken as fuc
4:42:24 | OblivionCreator: does tf2c even support 100players?
4:42:38 | Inc0m1ng: i thought it supported 128 player servers
4:42:41 | Frost Byte: ive seen tf2c support as high as 64
4:42:43 | Inc0m1ng: I know they have 64 player servers
4:42:59 | OblivionCreator: I have, it sucks, i love it
4:43:13 | looniestbore3: I hate it
4:43:19 | firechaos70: I'm taking a brake for lunch.
4:43:24 | OblivionCreator: it doesn't! that's what's great
4:43:28 | dustloaf: because SENSORY OVErLOAD
4:43:39 | Frost Byte: eh idk i wont say 4 team is good but i enjoy it
4:43:39 | Eric Peterson: How does having random crits on vs off affect the feel of 100 player?
4:43:50 | OblivionCreator: have you ever truly lived until you've played class wars on ctf_4fort as civilian
4:43:55 | Rovan: apples to oranges, but a third team is so fucking frustrating to play with in ffxiv pvp
4:44:01 | Inc0m1ng: I thought frigid made 4 teams work in tf2c admittidly
4:44:03 | Lovecraft Gaming: chaos is fun
4:44:09 | Nuggets: Bring L4D2's Dark Carnival map over and stick a payload cart in it kappa
4:44:10 | RatsInYourWalls: 50,000 player server
4:44:14 | Inc0m1ng: most of the other maps are ass but frigid forced engagement
4:44:48 | Lockrum: [guy implementing a gimmick voice] why are you guys so obsessed with gimmicks
4:45:01 | someone's account : Why are orange cats always the dumbest ones?

4:48:24 | Xnery: we need to see the legs
4:48:27 | OblivionCreator: as there's a catgirl now i've reformed and suddenly think new gimmicks are bad, actually
4:48:33 | missing.trigger: you need to fix it first
4:48:39 | Eric Peterson: If Demo could equip the Gunboots in the primary slot do you think you'd use them?
4:49:00 | Doctor Sandvich: wait maybe selbyen?
4:49:00 | cav: why be a catgirl when you can be a manther
4:49:01 | firechaos70: no...
4:49:04 | igorka5. exe: so now we are in business
4:49:04 | Václav Němec: the cat shounic has legs so I think the catboy one should also have legs
4:49:10 | mmmmicrowave: much sexy
4:49:23 | OblivionCreator: can we meet in the middle and give your regular icon the programmer socks then
4:49:56 | Nexus: why cant i use my items in the server lol
4:49:56 | cav: dead mod

4:50:23 | Xnery: this is so sad
4:50:29 | Allumi: you should prob ping the discord at this rate
4:50:34 | igorka5. exe: they all stopped the game to buy gamer socks
4:50:51 | igorka5. exe: we need the reaction speed
4:50:54 | Xnery: steam validation rejected
4:51:13 | The Goose: they're buying Shounic vtuber merch with their favorite waifu
4:52:03 | Václav Němec: put a black box over it xd
4:52:11 | igorka5. exe: trim the original 
4:52:15 | Pompmaker1: the original avatar became the big plushie beanbag for the catboy to lean on
4:52:22 | igorka5. exe: so only the lines are there
4:52:31 | Inc0m1ng: why is shounic converting into a femboy
4:52:39 | lostme: random leg incoming

4:53:28 | Pompmaker1: I knew the moment I posted it that shounic would find a way to use it
4:53:37 | igorka5. exe: the technology has gone too far 
4:53:37 | The Real Pika: its his femboy arc
4:53:37 | Pompmaker1: as a true gamer he cannot resist the urge to become a femboy
4:53:38 | looniestbore3: i love it

4:58:17 | Jozef: when the server gets filled the catboy gets upgraded to a catman
4:58:34 | Grogcito: I'm leaving

5:08:02 | Me: this point is just spam on both sides
5:08:14 | Xnery: im abusing a degenerate demo sightline
5:08:15 | Inc0m1ng: give yourself a valve rocket launcher and solve it
5:08:18 | Xnery: i dont think this map is it
5:08:25 | literatemax: blu just has to take the hallway on your right and put tele exits in it and they can win
5:08:28 | firechaos70: 145
5:08:39 | Fogapod: what is the most amount of entities you can generate? 14 stickies from scottish resistance + fire a couple pipes + start cannon riding taunt?
5:08:41 | Pompmaker1: it's so natural
5:08:45 | literatemax: *raises hand* i thought it was cute lol
5:08:50 | come 2 brasil: it's normal

5:46:32 | Inc0m1ng: my internet is shitting bricks what happened
5:46:49 | Alfonzo: shounic sends you to the 100 player weed zone
5:46:51 | literatemax: theyll just 5-star the funny maps like wutville
5:46:57 | Grogcito: Add a voting screen at the end of the match like in casual :shotroll:
5:46:59 | terry muse: what if the server had something like a shitmap Sunday? for one day the map rotation switches to include all the silly maps and the rest of the week is actual tf2
5:47:11 | Someguywholikesart: ^^^
5:47:13 | come 2 brasil: i just you just have the voting on discord
5:47:13 | Moncalf: there is an end of map plug-in and its literally puts a poll up that is just thumbs up or thumbs down 
5:47:29 | firechaos70: in the end it doesn't even matter
5:47:49 | Moncalf: the vote plugin is pretty decent it gives maps a % 
5:47:52 | Alfonzo: it you do it, don't do it on sunday, do it on something like a monday or tuesday 
5:48:02 | Grogcito: Sunday is the worst day to do that lol
5:48:11 | come 2 brasil: if they want to play dustbowl then they would be fine with playing fucking trade_plazza

5:50:46 | Grogcito: Make the server random crit and force cp_orange once a week
5:51:02 | come 2 brasil: so then just cycle the maps every other week or something
5:51:15 | Fogapod: is there reload cheat? force a nature scout was killing me seemingly 1 shot launching me to space. another time a single spawn camping soldier killed me with 1 stock rocket with no crit multiple times
5:51:22 | Xnery: hi tf2 chat
5:51:23 | Foxxxy: one map per week? Hell no

5:53:24 | Doctor Sandvich: uhh why the hell did i get kicked ?

5:58:28 | Inc0m1ng: if we get him a femboy bf then we can get one round of wacky races
5:58:31 | Pompmaker1: the alamo returns
5:58:46 | Water -: why not make him the femboy bf instead
5:59:24 | Someguywholikesart: Good question.
5:59:26 | Inc0m1ng: finally I can piss

6:29:36 | Joshua Pinkham: shounic you need to add 3 more femboys to reach the optimal femboy limit
6:29:42 | Kiwi_ Pancake: look the discord memes
6:29:42 | Alfonzo: I think the orange zone can be winnable
6:29:44 | Inc0m1ng: pramge aimt win
6:29:44 | SuperStarPL: i think the orange zone can be winnable :3
6:29:46 | Xnery: too soon to tell who knows
6:29:46 | omahasamman: IT NEEDS ANOTHER FLANKK BUT IT IS POSSABLE TO WIN
6:29:47 | SuperStarPL: rawr :3
6:29:52 | Water -: orange zone is winnable but you really need to coordinate ubers or something
6:29:52 | magicUFO Show: I think the orange zone can be winnable
6:29:54 | Mr.Kleiner: @shounic WATCH THIS
6:29:55 | c irukandji: i think once you've played it a few times you could win it
6:29:56 | Water -: and that makes it improbable
6:29:59 | Xnery: we literally ignored one doorway for the entire round
6:30:12 | Kiwi_ Pancake: look the discord memes
6:30:15 | John-John VonJohn: you need a couple of ubers though flank
6:30:25 | Inc0m1ng: we win or we become femboys 
6:30:27 | c irukandji: i'm on defence now, and just got here lol

6:31:01 | Kiwi_ Pancake: look the discord memes
6:31:10 | Water -: i mean, badwater expects like 1-2 ubers anyway most times
6:31:14 | Water -: for last at least
6:31:42 | poopideeshroop: the two behind you better be femboys
6:31:50 | c irukandji: not having the cart outline is SO annoying
6:31:53 | Kiwi_ Pancake: look the discord memes
6:31:55 | Kiwi_ Pancake: look the discord memes
6:32:42 | come 2 brasil: should i be worried that shounic doesn't recognize the animated porn spray, or worried that "I" do recognize it
6:32:52 | Royce Bracket: the latter
6:33:01 | Pompmaker1: it's like cp_orange
6:33:06 | Václav Němec: I don't think you would be able to tell where to go without the cart outline
6:33:29 | Water -: imagine turning it into a mall

6:36:09 | OblivionCreator: btw the femboys are asymmetrical, can we also have 2 femboys on the left side of the screen to improve the feng shui
6:36:22 | Inc0m1ng: what if tf2 got updated. that would be a weird gimmick tbh
6:36:36 | Alfonzo: Team Fortress 2 the femboy update

7:53:32 | Davetrap: FREE 2FORT
7:53:50 | (New member) Linku: Cosidering it's 50/50 if red or blu win I say this map is pretty good
7:53:58 | igorka5. exe: go on mge while testing the maps
7:53:59 | Jack Rushen: There's a spot near blue spawn where a tele can be built that traps players
7:54:17 | Xnery: @tommya that's him
7:55:12 | Mr.Kleiner: is this wutville
7:55:33 | Xnery: it's taking a while to download the map

7:57:27 | Funny Man haha: play undertale
7:58:03 | itchylol742: thats what they said about russia
7:58:29 | tommya: Invading an island country is hard
7:58:47 | Moncalf: its doable but then they also still lose taiwan from how much damage it'd take to take it
7:58:48 | Inc0m1ng: dodm'
7:58:49 | Inc0m1ng: asdlkpflpasdf
7:58:52 | Inc0m1ng: fuck
7:58:56 | Inc0m1ng: ignore that
7:58:58 | Mr.Kleiner: yeah ok but what if they just bomb it with rockets ??
7:58:59 | blobbem: Considering how a bunch of Chiense missiles were filled with water instead of, y'know, fuel because of corruption probably put a pin in any Taiwan invasion plans.
7:59:01 | Inc0m1ng: among us
7:59:02 | Xnery: can you just ban that guy
7:59:02 | 0scr_: still lots of people are going to die for nothing

8:01:23 | Funny Man haha: hey shounic listen you were the one being sexist earlier...

8:02:12 | 0scr_: I don't believe it
8:02:13 | Moncalf: you gonna get any more guests on stream? can be good when talking about maps to add to trenches
8:02:14 | Mr.Kleiner: BLU has the fucking highground. We're on RED are doing so fucking well relative to the current situation
8:02:21 | itchylol742: yeah we want guests!
8:02:24 | Sydney Sininen: pls don't unmute him lol

8:02:52 | Davetrap: WOOHOO
8:02:52 | tommya: #capitalism

8:03:00 | Xnery: shounic you need to leave

8:03:09 | SuperStarPL: I can pay you $300
8:03:12 | Funny Man haha: JUST GO SPECTATE
8:03:12 | Scrumby & Plumbo: This bastard was pouting in spawn instead of playing 
8:03:13 | Inc0m1ng: maybe playing demo with medics pocketing you is too much
8:03:13 | Inc0m1ng: lol
8:03:14 | Funny Man haha: GO SPECTATE

8:07:40 | trex: do spy for the memes..............or not i dont care lol also hello world
8:07:55 | Banana Horse 37: Always good to see a shounic stream, hope it isn't being too stressful dealing with 100 players
8:08:06 | Sydney Sininen: itd make a good video essay at least
8:08:51 | Inc0m1ng: hope I haven't been an issue 
8:09:14 | itchylol742: complain but in a funny way
8:09:18 | Inc0m1ng: its up to you 
8:09:20 | tommya: If I were you, I'd disable chat and sprays when streaming, it's sad but we live in a society
8:09:25 | igorka5. exe: have i been an issue?
8:09:30 | Inc0m1ng: do what you want, its your stream
8:09:37 | Banana Horse 37: Oh, you didn't disable sprays during stream?
8:10:00 | Joshua Pinkham: hey shounic do you like looking at pictures of male cats?
8:10:21 | Sydney Sininen: watching on my phone, is server full rn?
8:10:28 | Funny Man haha: ok i hear you
8:10:43 | Matty: Hey @shounic, you should have a great day.
8:10:52 | lostme: since you don't really drink tea, what do you drink?
8:10:58 | blobbem: Move over backseat gaming, we onto backseat streaming.
8:11:09 | Funny Man haha: I DIDNT MEAN NOTHIN BY IT I SWEAR
8:11:13 | Moncalf: you should play dispenser :slightly_smiling_face: 
8:11:16 | tommya: You don't have to listen to them!
8:11:39 | Davetrap: SHOUNIC WERE TRAPPED IN SPAWN
8:11:41 | Davetrap: HELP
8:11:42 | Inc0m1ng: not much you can do about it
8:11:46 | Davetrap: (im on red)
8:12:06 | Funny Man haha: tbh i would have stopped asking about the map if u told me to earlier. my b
8:12:17 | Funny Man haha: i was definitely being that unfunny fella earlier lool
8:12:41 | Kalinka: hahaha
8:12:51 | Matty: You're here to do something specific, yes, but you want to have a good time doing so.
8:12:59 | Davetrap: i just saved your ass from a pyro
8:12:59 | Matty: And chat can be...
8:13:03 | Matty: ...interesting, sometimes.
8:13:36 | Banana Horse 37: Just to get a reaction, yes
8:13:37 | FreeAndLit: averange stream exprience
8:13:43 | Buttered Egg: dam doood ur still streaming?
8:13:56 | itchylol742: i think having a guest on stream would help
8:14:03 | tommya: Perhaps that's just indicative of the TF2 community in general
8:14:07 | Matty: It was beating a dead horse, tbh.
8:14:21 | Banana Horse 37: Oh yeah, having guests can be fun
8:14:35 | Banana Horse 37: Yup
8:14:43 | Funny Man haha: idk why people want wacky races or balloon race anyway they stink on 100 players
8:15:15 | mark: can we have perks
8:15:24 | Matty: Sometimes it has to be a hard line.
8:15:28 | lam lam: yup, thats sad
8:15:28 | Nieno: Just straight banning them would help a lot
8:15:34 | Matty: It's YOUR stream.
8:15:37 | Matty: Not theirs.
8:16:04 | Davetrap: the stream is like 4 seconds delayed
8:16:06 | Kalinka: sho do you take suggestion maps
8:16:49 | mark: theres people you need to ban and then theres people you want to ban
8:16:51 | tommya: Either you can embrace it or fight it :person_shrugging:
8:17:01 | Nieno: People would always complain, it's a fine line but it must be taken 
8:17:13 | Matty: It's chaos, both good and bad.
8:17:19 | Banana Horse 37: Just have fun with it
8:17:31 | Inc0m1ng: It probably doesn't help that you have a clear goal then with the stream cause then everyone has conflict of interest but I understand your point
8:17:49 | Inc0m1ng: you can only really make the best of what you're given, even if you aren't given what you want
8:18:00 | tommya: We live in a society
8:18:07 | mark: ishowspeed streams 
8:18:09 | Nieno: I've seen people complaining, whining about unfairly being banned when in reality they were spamming the n-word 
8:18:20 | Nieno: It's always like that
8:18:20 | Moothebar: youtube is not a streaming platform yet it supports streaming
8:18:28 | itchylol742: we love dougdoug
8:18:40 | Moothebar: youtube streaming is so poorly added
8:18:53 | idiot e: unionising is awesome
8:18:55 | itchylol742: chat is unironically part of what makes dougdoug great
8:18:56 | 0scr_: dude come russia, we have police actually policing internets
8:19:00 | Zerobrine: when in doubt, just get chat mods lol 
8:19:06 | 0scr_: it's not good either
8:19:06 | Matty: If only Youtube did proper streams...would be good.
8:19:18 | Funny Man haha: disable chat NOW.............
8:19:24 | tommya: Youtube needs thought police:face-blue-smiling:
8:19:41 | itchylol742: everyone lives and dies by something, yours is tf2
8:19:45 | lostme: shounic, it's not the time to bring this up, but the submission bot is doubleposting
8:19:46 | mark: just trust random people
8:20:24 | TheGhostThatWas: you get more than one mod so there's a better chance at least one of them will be watching at a time
8:20:28 | Funny Man haha: shounic if you have a chatter that you disagree with just install a button that gives them a painful stroke
8:20:44 | Matty: I was going to suggest the mods as well, but I've only seen you streaming here and there, mainly for the custom map that chat made, and now more custom maps.
8:21:08 | Davetrap: i use reanimation
8:21:13 | Davetrap: because they look floppy
8:21:16 | stattek: horse moderation
8:21:23 | Funny Man haha: it is contextual yah
8:21:23 | Matty: If you did have a team, it would be able to help you to build a ruleset.
8:21:37 | Matty: Yes, there's context to be dealt with, but it would certainly help.
8:21:41 | MayorIguanaFTW: just make everyone a mod, I'm sure it would go swimmingly
8:21:56 | Banana Horse 37: Isn't this all overthinking?
8:22:07 | TheGhostThatWas: you can just have it be a thing where you say "mods ban that guy since I'm busy". I've seen streamers do that before
8:22:13 | Matty: Streaming a bunch doesn't make sense at the current time.
8:22:22 | Banana Horse 37: Oh shi- sorry
8:22:27 | GoofyGamer68: A
8:22:34 | ReimuHakureiShrine: Shounic why are there a bunch of catgirls
8:22:41 | Kalinka: @shounic try sidewinder
8:22:44 | Joshua Pinkham: they are catboys
8:22:47 | Banana Horse 37: Because he's a heterosexual cat
8:22:50 | Banana Horse 37: Oh
8:22:54 | Xnery: you get frustrated
8:22:54 | Funny Man haha: are you having fun yet
8:22:56 | itchylol742: have reminders to donate money :)
8:23:10 | TheGhostThatWas: does the exposure help at all for the server
8:23:13 | igorka5. exe: do you get fun?
8:23:14 | Matty: Also...I did come in mid-way through the stream, and I do have to ask: what is with the two behind the cat? 
8:23:18 | T H: Its 1 am my time
8:23:19 | tommya: TF2 players are too poor to donate :pensive_face:
8:23:24 | Xnery: rare blu sided pl map

8:25:43 | Sydney Sininen: I haven't watched your streams before this but it's been really relaxing to listen to
8:25:44 | Funny Man haha: no tower..
8:25:47 | MayorIguanaFTW: streaming makes you realize how hard it is to keep up a constant dialogue
8:25:48 | igorka5. exe: person that drew it said it is a girl
8:25:57 | Matty: Appreciate the explanation. Also, you do a wonderful job trying to get things done under the bright lights (the stage metaphor is quite right).
8:26:00 | terry muse: been tuning in and out between work yday and today and its been very chill and cool stream yeah
8:26:05 | Zerobrine: payload race sounds like fucking chaos with 100 players :skull:
8:26:18 | Funny Man haha: is that a cs map
8:26:25 | Banana Horse 37: Talking about maps, Valor's creator got accused by Jesty of raiding his stream or something
8:26:42 | Václav Němec: wtf, you are still streaming? xd where did the carboys go? :d
8:26:45 | Funny Man haha: this one looks pretty
8:26:58 | Davetrap: look at the front page of tf2
8:26:59 | lostme: mom I'm on the tv
8:27:00 | Funny Man haha: no
8:27:00 | Banana Horse 37: No
8:27:01 | tommya: How much u make in ad revenue per month?

8:27:13 | Banana Horse 37: Hi mommy
8:27:15 | Matty: Also hi stream
8:27:19 | Davetrap: look at the front of the tf2 workshop
8:27:21 | Mr.Kleiner: Pro tip: There's no balance. It's just the matter of who has the most medics. Fuck
8:27:26 | Sydney Sininen: hello chat
8:27:27 | Funny Man haha: shounic we'll get u a massage chair
8:27:29 | 0scr_: It sucks in a good way

8:28:49 | Gavin: just time out annoying people
8:28:59 | Funny Man haha: whats the difference with this map
8:28:59 | Funny Man haha: ?
8:29:02 | 0scr_: warning system
8:29:05 | 0scr_: moderators
8:29:13 | Sydney Sininen: it sounds like a back and forth between viewers and streamers to build culture
8:29:14 | tommya: You could try a paid only chat, but I would be against that personally
8:29:15 | Xnery: you can scold them like a parent
8:29:19 | Inc0m1ng: He's gonna put me in timeout oh god
8:29:23 | Xnery: RIP GAVIN
8:29:27 | Matty: Lmao, timeout time
8:29:29 | DieAhatSchnecke: 10s timeout the biggest punishment
8:29:30 | Banana Horse 37: Poor Gavin
8:29:36 | MayorIguanaFTW: nooo Gavin D:
8:29:37 | Gavin: it doesnt even say anything
8:29:40 | Zerobrine: Idk, aggressive moderation sucks, it's better to just be super lenient unless chat is going crazy
8:29:45 | Funny Man haha: Timeout on youtube is actually really bad because if you get timed out, and dont get unmuted, you can't get unmuted after the stream
8:29:46 | Xnery: LOL
8:29:46 | Davetrap: try the outback map it looks intresting
8:29:52 | Banana Horse 37: YouTube doesn't take anything serious tbh :3c
8:29:52 | lostme: the lore books
8:29:56 | Moothebar: youtube actually ddoing good stream stuff???
8:29:59 | Matty: Looks like they're trying to take a bit from Twitch
8:30:00 | Kalinka: thought police at it
8:30:16 | igorka5. exe: don't look through the my staff
8:30:17 | Funny Man haha: be nice.
8:30:18 | Liokindy: hi shonic
8:30:19 | Funny Man haha: BE NICE.
8:30:20 | Inc0m1ng: shounic is exposing people's messages lmao
8:30:21 | decrpt: i just came back what happened to the femboys 
8:30:21 | Banana Horse 37: Lemme fix that
8:30:22 | igorka5. exe: it will be bad

8:31:03 | poopy inc.: Phlegm macorin 
8:31:03 | Liokindy: COPYRIGHT INCOMING!!
8:31:08 | Inc0m1ng: what
8:31:13 | Banana Horse 37: You killed him
8:31:15 | Funny Man haha: @Gavin hii
8:31:16 | Davetrap: you murdered gavin
8:31:18 | Gavin: yea it didnt tell me i got timed out
8:31:23 | liffey: play vivaldi
8:31:23 | Matty: There he is
8:31:27 | fish: your still life?
8:31:39 | igorka5. exe: time me out i will say 
8:31:40 | Václav Němec: I think it tells you when you try writing something again
8:31:42 | itchylol742: rip xerny. we will remember you o7
8:31:47 | Sydney Sininen: I agree on vivaldi lol
8:31:48 | MayorIguanaFTW: he's gone mad with power, we're dropping like flies
8:31:53 | Lgmrszd: it should tell tbh
8:31:54 | tommya: I like the 10s timeout, it's super petty
8:31:55 | Link99ts6wed: HI
8:31:55 | FreeAndLit: rip xerny
8:31:55 | Matty: That looks nice
8:31:57 | Funny Man haha: i like it. looks good.
8:32:02 | Banana Horse 37: That Upward looks sick
8:32:02 | Liokindy: have you tried payload race in 100 players already?
8:32:03 | Funny Man haha: we votekicked you
8:32:09 | Hermanni: I tried plr_upward a couple times on TF2 classic, it's kinda fun
8:32:20 | igorka5. exe: twitch is much better with the chat interactions
8:32:24 | Xnery: sent you a dm
8:32:27 | Bradasparky: "somehow" we're having fun
8:32:32 | Funny Man haha: no. we votekicked you. i would never lie
8:32:37 | Liokindy: twitch kinda sucks
8:32:42 | Inc0m1ng: at least you're honest
8:32:51 | Zerobrine: I think timeouts just blurs out the chat box, that's like the only way to tell if you're muted
8:32:55 | Matty: I get wanting to have both, but if you have a following on one...
8:32:57 | Allumi: im pretty sure like half the maps we played over the past 2 days were submitted by mr
8:33:01 | Banana Horse 37: Dear god
8:33:01 | Allumi: me
8:33:05 | Matty: Besides, Twitch is definitely going downhill
8:33:11 | Funny Man haha: im sure theres a setup timer
8:33:16 | Funny Man haha: right?
8:33:23 | Banana Horse 37: Oh, it's PLR
8:33:23 | Moothebar: YouTube chat has no predictions, channels points and all the other good features
8:33:29 | tommya: I use twitch and yt about equally
8:33:29 | igorka5. exe: you can stream on both youtube and twitch at the same time 
8:33:44 | Matty: Woooooow
8:33:45 | Liokindy: shounic whats your take on yellow cats? do you like other colors more?
8:33:46 | DieAhatSchnecke: that mid sightline oof
8:33:50 | Banana Horse 37: Uh oh
8:33:53 | Pangloss: oh god those sightlines
8:33:57 | Inc0m1ng: called out
8:33:57 | blobbem: Time him out again for 10 seconds as punishment.
8:33:58 | Václav Němec: youtube ships features to people at different times too
8:34:00 | Gavin: i meant no alert when u get timed out only when u type
8:34:14 | Link99ts6wed: Finger gun :water_pistol:
8:34:29 | MEEM: what is this god forsaken map
8:34:33 | Matty: THE GOOD VIBES ARE BACK
8:34:49 | DieAhatSchnecke: I think you worry too much about slapping annoying people
8:34:56 | Matty: Don't worry about popularity, you are plenty popular.
8:35:12 | Xnery: you are an asshole tho
8:35:13 | Matty: You have a ton of subs, and you have people that always come to your streams when you do stream.
8:35:18 | Banana Horse 37: You're literally chill
8:35:22 | itchylol742: zesty has a reputation for being an asshole but he just keeps going
8:35:32 | Banana Horse 37: What
8:35:36 | FreeAndLit: grumpy sho
8:35:41 | Moncalf: greg
8:35:44 | itchylol742: D:
8:35:49 | MayorIguanaFTW: uh oh
8:35:56 | blobbem: You probably have a decent enough sense to time out the people who genuinely deserve it. Probably.
8:35:58 | MEEM: theres alot of m's
8:36:06 | Xnery: shounic has a rep of abusing mappers
8:36:11 | Matty: People take shit and run with it
8:36:13 | Matty: Way too mcuh
8:36:13 | Liokindy: youre such an asshole :red_heart::red_heart:
8:36:16 | Matty: *much
8:36:31 | Joshua Pinkham: there are a lot of people here who start with the letter m
8:36:37 | DieAhatSchnecke: I think you'd need to slap like HUNDREDS of people a week for a rep like that to form
8:36:38 | itchylol742: who cares if people believes lies about you? people who believe lies without proof aren't worth consideration
8:36:50 | lostme: you make a goofy 'mods timeout this guy' thing like jerma and nobody bats an eye
8:36:51 | Liokindy: >bans cheater
8:36:54 | Zerobrine: Bro we'd back you up tho fr, bad actors are gonna try to spin your image and say you're an ass when you ain't, it happens
8:37:06 | Inc0m1ng: idk people have one bad moment and it represents them for life
8:37:13 | Inc0m1ng: so that's debatable
8:37:16 | Liokindy: >bans cheater >cheater comes out as lgbt >gets cancelled bc of it, even tho he was banned becaues he was cheating
8:37:26 | Banana Horse 37: Like the bridge with pewds
8:37:50 | Funny Man haha: huh
8:37:53 | Funny Man haha: whats happs
8:37:55 | DieAhatSchnecke: its understandable, take your time chief
8:37:55 | Mr.Kleiner: no time limit map lets goooo
8:38:03 | Frost Byte: wait shounic plays other classes?
8:38:16 | Liokindy: wait shounic actually plays the game?
8:38:29 | DieAhatSchnecke: In general I just dont think you are exactly a drama target, you're just a chill cat man
8:38:30 | Banana Horse 37: Wait, who's shounic?
8:38:52 | Xnery: call them out
8:38:59 | Xnery: just like in the discord server
8:39:02 | Zerobrine: If someone tells a bad joke, we just -2 them and tell them to never tell a joke ever again
8:39:09 | Funny Man haha: DM them??
8:39:11 | Funny Man haha: idk
8:39:11 | Liokindy: oh hi cinderace
8:39:20 | itchylol742: i am going to dinner now. but i just want you to know i am invested in this discussion
8:39:21 | Cat in Space: jerma?
8:39:22 | Funny Man haha: -2
8:39:23 | DieAhatSchnecke: someone just made an awkward joke in this chat and the message is already gone
8:39:28 | DieAhatSchnecke: imo its only a problem if they spam
8:39:29 | Liokindy: who's jerma
8:39:34 | Zerobrine: everyone's chat is now just -2 because of jerma lmao
8:39:35 | blobbem: I'd just timeout aggressive backseaters and racist stuff. Repeat offenders get banned.
8:39:54 | Funny Man haha: -2 conversation. next game
8:39:58 | Funny Man haha: kidding ofc
8:40:21 | Inc0m1ng: did you want us to come back lol
8:40:21 | lostme: I never were here before
8:40:38 | DieAhatSchnecke: twitch chatters typically have more chat culture than yt chatters from my exp
8:40:45 | Funny Man haha: 6% of your women viewers just left.
8:40:50 | Liokindy: honestly the big reason why i dont watch streams/lives is because of streamers personalities now a days
8:40:53 | Inc0m1ng: I'll try my best then
8:40:53 | Zerobrine: Issue with YouTube is when the people I watch are livestreaming, I don't get told lol
8:41:21 | Jaden:  looking into this...
8:41:24 | Zerobrine: I try to watch a Tyler McVicker stream when I can but like, YouTube doesn't tell me, I have to check myself and just try to remember their schedule
8:41:29 | Sydney Sininen: I wish I had the wifi to stream multiplayer games, it sounds like a lot of fun
8:41:37 | Liokindy: The less people: Less chaotic chat and mostly more friendly. The more people: big mass of negative IQ
8:41:40 | Moncalf: he called the regulars cringe PepeHands 
8:41:53 | Davetrap: i thnk we may have a few aimbotters
8:42:01 | Inc0m1ng: premier tab and community tab
8:42:02 | Funny Man haha: do you think you'll be able to get like your server admins to join the streams more often? since they are good actors to the community? (im playing the game and will not listen to ur response)
8:42:02 | Inc0m1ng: lol
8:42:10 | Jaden: i like watching the streams at work, keeps me entertained 
8:42:25 | Cat in Space: does he even focus on the game?

9:23:57 | herbert: what if people just build on the roof?
9:23:58 | Jaden: what if we had a lot of fun
9:24:12 | Joshua Pinkham: it would nice to have streams be designated as serious or funny
9:24:38 | Grogcito: this is serious though
9:24:39 | Jaden: could work
9:24:51 | tommya: It's hard to take tf2 seriously tbh
9:25:23 | herbert: theres no stopping engineers from building on the roof?
9:25:27 | tommya: It's such a silly game
9:25:50 | Sydney Sininen: I've been playing too much Ultrakill, I forgot there was fall damage here
9:25:54 | Zerobrine: There's probably random "no build" brushes left over from pasting other maps
9:25:57 | Jonny: all good ideas seem silly at first
9:26:06 | Joshua Pinkham: but that kind of thing hinges on having an actual stream schedule
9:26:12 | Zerobrine: surely an engi has tried building on a roof by now
9:26:16 | Jaden: can we put this on the trenches for like a day
9:26:33 | Jaden: right
9:26:40 | herbert: is it even possible for blu to take last?
9:27:00 | tommya: Do you currently have a favorite map not made by yourself?
9:27:03 | Ak: this map shouldn't exist
9:27:09 | tommya: Just as a reference for a good map
9:27:35 | Moncalf: this is fixable
9:27:39 | jep0rox: the problem with adding dumb maps is people will always vote for them over normal maps
9:27:42 | Moncalf: this is almost a good map
9:27:48 | Jaden: yeah i understand
9:27:58 | 0scr_: tbh a server with just workshop maps sounds kinda fun
9:28:00 | Zerobrine: this is playable tho and actually fits the 100 players, a bit
9:28:15 | Massa Folhada Oficial: simply host another 100 player server with public upload enabled
9:28:37 | herbert: i want to learn how to map so i can make maps designed for 100 players
9:28:38 | Inc0m1ng: grr I demand more 2048 
9:28:39 | Moncalf: getting on the roofs finally is fun
9:28:55 | Moncalf: though getting under and outside the map needs to be fixed
9:29:17 | Zerobrine: 80% if not 90% of like wacky maps aren't gonna work with 100 players so eventually they'll have to get it through their head, I dunno
9:29:25 | herbert: horrible idea: 100 players with rtd
9:29:41 | Inc0m1ng: wasn't that a skial server
9:29:55 | Inc0m1ng: they had a 100 player server but it had rtd which is why I switched to trenches lol
9:30:02 | Grogcito: Speak for yourself, we definitely would like that
9:30:02 | jep0rox: you can play it seriously but that doesn't change the fact it's a meme map
9:30:12 | jep0rox: it's the 3 worst maps stitched together
9:30:14 | Davetrap: shounic add this map but make it more balanced
9:30:34 | Jaden: you can do whatever you want with your server
9:30:35 | Zerobrine: It's simple what the map submission criteria is: Playable, has to fit 100 players, has to have an actual objective, no massive sniper sightlines, not a tight fit so splash damage isn't abused
9:30:35 | Sydney Sininen: Yeah you're trying to curate the optimal vibe
9:30:36 | Kalinka: MF is still going
9:30:47 | herbert: worse idea: turn this into 5cp and play it like 6s
9:31:29 | Jaden: oh i know i just think you should be allowed to do what you think is best
9:31:36 | Kalinka: shounic can you remove my ban on discord, woke moralists have banned me...
9:31:45 | jep0rox: did you try finished asteroid or does it have too many entities?
9:31:47 | Juest Zungo: how about a 100p tc map?
9:32:11 | Inc0m1ng: caper was one I recommended
9:32:12 | igorka5. exe: my cat is trying to eat me 
9:32:14 | igorka5. exe: help
9:32:17 | Jaden: lmao that's understandable
9:32:24 | Ak: eat the cat back
9:32:25 | Kalinka: dont deprive me from your voice
9:32:38 | OblivionCreator: I will never understand people who get banned from a platform, then jump into another platform saying "I just got banned from X", like thanks for telling me so I can copy the ban across??
9:32:59 | Xnery: LOL
9:33:01 | Xnery: kalinka
9:33:02 | Kalinka: i was talking about south america lmao
9:33:04 | Quasi404: lol 
9:33:06 | Xnery: youre a loser
9:33:12 | Kalinka: WOKE MORALISTS
9:33:12 | Václav Němec: lmao what did he do
9:33:26 | Kalinka: joke
9:33:29 | Sydney Sininen: Garfield, are you /j or /s
9:33:32 | Jaden: you sound cringe i see why you were banned
9:33:50 | herbert: ive only ever been banned from one streamer. it was on twitch and i was banned from letsgameitout chat lol
9:33:57 | λndrew: I’m a moral wokist
9:33:58 | OblivionCreator: woke moralists?? based actually
9:33:58 | Kalinka: ill dm you
9:33:59 | Sydney Sininen: the sarcasm didn't penetrate the Chat Filter
9:34:15 | SleepyEngi: I have been banned from the mickey mouse club for innapropiate behavior :(((
9:34:24 | herbert: :(
9:34:26 | Moncalf: I've only ever heard woke moralists from a clip from a "meme" that was whats that guy jordan peterson upset from getting banned on twitter or something
9:34:46 | Sydney Sininen: help we're lost
9:34:48 | jep0rox: the fact you've got a 100 player server fully and I think an 80 player server is wild
9:34:51 | literatemax: i love this map
9:34:52 | Bradasparky: @SleepyEngi hello JP
9:34:53 | Kalinka: add/look up sidewinder
9:34:56 | Rezy: what a good map design
9:35:00 | Kalinka: its a great map
9:35:03 | Rezy: THERE IS NO ARROW
9:35:05 | herbert: best map fr
9:35:21 | Joshua Pinkham: im
9:35:31 | herbert: c r i t
9:35:49 | Joshua Pinkham: im pretty sure we already looked at sidewinder
9:35:57 | Juest Zungo: yeah can we not bring drama here please?
9:36:01 | Zacco: Where are you getting these maps from? I've got one I'd love to see played (It's mine)
9:36:22 | Zacco: darn I missed it I guess
9:36:24 | herbert: bros busy playing tf2, doesnt have time for ban appeals
9:36:25 | Kalinka: crash has good train usage
9:36:26 | literatemax: Zacco is it on the workshop? that would make it easier
9:36:33 | Jonny: what's your disdcord server?
9:36:34 | Xnery: this map is so dark i cant tell which team people are on
9:36:41 | igorka5. exe: welp gg, i am going to sleep now 
9:36:47 | Inc0m1ng: are we doing another stream like this speak of or are you making the dbz video first
9:36:57 | Ak: the autobalance plugin is playing ping pong with me
9:37:03 | igorka5. exe: great time was spent here
9:37:18 | Juest Zungo: how does the engineer survive?
9:37:21 | Fella: are the tf2 servers still down
9:37:21 | pablito: This map so dark I swear I just saw purple demoman
9:37:22 | Jaden: lmao
9:37:26 | Grogcito: Dude I love that tele
9:37:26 | OblivionCreator: that's an amazing teleporter
9:37:27 | Rezy: lmaoo
9:37:43 | Zacco: @literatemax not yet, It's in beta 
9:37:47 | Grogcito: holy shit admin abuse
9:37:57 | KX2I: i know a bunch of goofy arena/1cp maps
9:38:03 | OblivionCreator: It has recently come to my attention that I have not been banned from your Discord server. Thank you for your cooperation /j
9:38:05 | Rezy: how much does it cost to run a 100 player server
9:38:06 | DDA 123: What about the bioshock map
9:38:20 | Juest Zungo: arena and koth is a bit of a no apparently
9:38:23 | Joshua Pinkham: it had a woman in it too scary
9:38:31 | herbert: terrifying
9:38:50 | Inc0m1ng: dude's going mad rn
9:38:50 | HAL 9000: take some rest shounic
9:38:54 | Davetrap: shounic the cube maps are missing texturs
9:38:54 | Jaden: what's been the reception on dbz so far 
9:38:56 | Davetrap: help
9:38:57 | Xnery: should i be taking this map seriously
9:39:29 | Jaden: if i said i thought it was just ok....
9:39:30 | Zerobrine: yes take it seriously >:)
9:39:38 | Sydney Sininen: I haven't gotten to play DBZ yet is it fun chat?
9:40:07 | Jaden: i can wait
9:40:19 | Joshua Pinkham: take map seriously in how they play and how fun they are
9:40:25 | Sydney Sininen: Shounic yuo need to spread your doses out
9:40:31 | Jaden: no i think it should stay i think it's nothing special
9:40:50 | Inc0m1ng: I like it lmao
9:40:52 | jep0rox: the last point just turns into a bit of a slugfest
9:41:03 | Inc0m1ng: whoever did the visuals did an excellent job in my opinion
9:41:07 | OblivionCreator: Another silly map so don't take this as an actual suggestion, but I'd love to see the chaos of trainsawlazer with 100 players
9:41:08 | Davetrap: i wanna go back to the worst map ever made
9:41:10 | Davetrap: that was fun
9:41:16 | Sydney Sininen: I can be universally liked, I'm sure my brain isn't delusional
9:41:20 | OblivionCreator: It'd be funny for like an hour but get boring but for that one hour it'd be fun
9:41:24 | jep0rox: and it runs at below 60fps
9:41:25 | Sydney Sininen: I think my therapist is just wrong
9:41:49 | herbert: im used to tf2 running at below 60fps
9:42:01 | Joshua Pinkham: real
9:42:18 | herbert: shounic killed zenith :0
9:42:21 | OblivionCreator: I think that comes a lot from trainsawlazer kinda being the first "popular" of those incredibly wacky maps
9:42:30 | Xnery: did you build a tolerance to trainsawlaser lol
9:42:37 | Zerobrine: try not to get out of the map challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)
9:42:43 | Jaden: "wahh why'd you kill me im friendly" 
9:43:01 | Bradasparky: start a war against friendlies
9:43:07 | Davetrap: we won
9:43:09 | Davetrap: woohoo
9:43:18 | Sydney Sininen: Participant retention is a bitch lol
9:43:29 | Sydney Sininen: That apparently happens way too often
9:43:34 | 0scr_: users being friendly is a metric of itself, some maps allow for it
9:43:36 | literatemax: well imo the presence of friendlies will give you more accurate data for the map's viability
9:43:38 | Sydney Sininen: In studies I mean
9:43:41 | herbert: red could put teles down there too
9:43:48 | Inc0m1ng: "we don't like your kind here" 
9:43:58 | Jaden: tried killing them irl?
9:43:58 | 0scr_: remember trade_* maps?
9:44:06 | Grogcito: But there are friendlies in the normal trenches too
9:44:13 | Grogcito: and grief teleporters, it's all part of the experiment
9:44:31 | Bradasparky: Have you paid attention to the ratio of friendlies to actual statues in spawn? I think the statues have them beat
9:44:40 | literatemax: exactly
9:44:41 | Grogcito: Yes, you should check if the map should be beaten with 10 afks on both teams
9:45:05 | Jaden: poor shounic
9:45:12 | λndrew: testing what it’s like when shounic is afk searching for maps
9:45:14 | Zerobrine: Imagine being a team of 4 map creators and one of them just doesn't even do anything, they just go taunt in a corner while the 3 people are left to test the map's balance on their own lmao
9:45:27 | Grogcito: poor shounic doesn't understand realistic environment testing :shoRJ:
9:45:32 | herbert: "how many friendlies does it take to finally lose in tf2"
9:45:40 | Jaden: so true grog...
9:45:51 | lostme: you should also test the map around having only 5 people to prepare for the time when server is empty
9:45:53 | 0scr_: oh wow what a discussion
9:46:08 | Jaden: i think we're both trolling
9:46:45 | Sydney Sininen: I understand why the valve maps have all those arrows now
9:46:48 | Grogcito: this is a shounic sarcasm reading test
9:46:50 | 0scr_: afk and frendlies is just what tf2 is
9:46:51 | Grogcito: You failed it
9:46:58 | herbert: whats the unusual on the sticky launcher?
9:47:00 | literatemax: is the point of this stream not to stress test these maps in a "real" context??? in tf2 a real context is that some peopke will be friendly. their presence here makes this test more accurate, not less
9:47:03 | λndrew: For every friendly one active player gets aimbot
9:47:05 | 0scr_: I'm sitting here writing in this chat instead of playing
9:47:35 | literatemax: no, unironically
9:47:36 | literatemax: is the point of this stream not to stress test these maps in a "real" context??? in tf2 a real context is that some peopke will be friendly. their presence here makes this test more accurate, not less
9:47:45 | Xnery: sarcasm battle
9:47:46 | Zerobrine: I ain't playing either don't worry, you're not alone 0scr
9:47:48 | Moncalf: mfs be like backpeddle into its just a prank bro do you not get humor when they werent funny
9:47:54 | lostme: wow sho is so grateful :shocrossedarms:
9:47:57 | herbert: pool party
9:48:11 | Zerobrine: It's like 1:50 AM and my hands are cold, I ain't in the mood to play shooter game 
9:48:20 | Joshua Pinkham: we chatters are truly the smartest beings in existence
9:48:32 | Bradasparky: make conclusions about your player base instead
9:49:05 | herbert: some people like playing friendly, so yeah
9:49:09 | literatemax: well a sample size of 1 match isnt gonna give you solid data anyways. youre changing too maps too often for any "real" conclusion already imo
9:49:21 | tw: theres going to be balance issues even without the friendlies
9:49:22 | lostme: grogcito trolled too close to the sun and broke shounic
9:49:25 | Lee Xuan: calm your tits shounic
9:49:29 | Zacco: maps should be tested with a full 12v12 team of people that are trying to complete the objective. Not tryharding, not competetive, just trying
9:49:29 | 0scr_: fun = good
9:49:44 | 0scr_: if map not fun = not good
9:49:51 | Grogcito: @lostme the trolling was too intense
9:49:56 | Doog: shounic does not have tits idiot
9:49:56 | λndrew: Get madder 
9:49:58 | Moncalf: shark attacks + nick cage movies data very insightful :thinking_face:
9:50:05 | pablito: 8 hours of gaming
9:50:23 | valerius0221: @shounic map is being tested for "how well it plays" and it is being tested in real situation. real server will have friendlies. if you test without them then 1 friendly will break balance in real gam
9:51:01 | herbert: finding which rooms friendlies go to will be useful information maybe
9:51:08 | Zacco: shounic you are right
9:51:16 | Zacco: -map maker
9:51:21 | Jaden: no i don't think friendlies should be accounted for lmao, game wasn't made around being friendly
9:51:35 | Zerobrine: Issue is, there was deadass that one map that looked fun to play on but like half the server decided to say "fuck it" and scurry under the map like a rat den in a KFC, nothing was gained lmao
9:51:40 | SleepyEngi: what would accounting for friendlies even mean
9:51:41 | valerius0221: @shounic map that doesn't account for them doesn't have counters for grief teles. after all sweat lords will never build grief tele :^)
9:51:49 | λndrew: Shounic will you marry me
9:51:54 | literatemax: non-participants? in that case, your data is garbage without class limits, so which is it?
9:51:56 | Bradasparky: Why not kick friendlies then? Why care about "retention" of people that don't want to play the game?
9:52:02 | literatemax: what if they use shotgun instead of sandvich
9:52:05 | lostme: the only map balanced around friendlies is full rng roulette
9:52:09 | literatemax: does that make the data suck
9:52:18 | Funny Man haha: Huh
9:52:23 | herbert: fat scout is still playing the game with the intent of completing the objective
9:52:25 | pablito: its only bunch of friendlies it doesnt matter
9:52:55 | Grogcito: this pool section is so bad
9:53:03 | Grogcito: with people building down there
9:53:07 | 0scr_: next map when?
9:53:10 | Sydney Sininen: I like heavy with shotty lol
9:53:17 | Joshua Pinkham: because the point of this server is for testing maps this kind of thing is fine on the trenches server but not here
9:53:21 | valerius0221: you sound like somebody who wants to turn everything in to competitive games with ranking :/
9:53:26 | FridgeDuck: I don't understand what's so hard to understand for people, ya can't account for human stupid antics when you mapmake
9:53:27 | herbert: should make no build under the water
9:53:30 | literatemax: no he doesnt
9:53:38 | Funny Man haha: you guys are going to give shounic a stroke
9:53:42 | Moncalf: didnt sho say this was the last map to test for the day?
9:53:44 | Funny Man haha: and i dont blame him
9:53:51 | Sydney Sininen: Yall are going through it rn
9:53:53 | Bradasparky: @valerius0221 That is a gross extreme of what he's asking for
9:53:55 | Grogcito: shounic will not reach the 10 hour mark at this rate
9:54:08 | Funny Man haha: chat you’re being so fucking stupid holy shit lmaoo
9:54:11 | herbert: no double digits :(
9:54:36 | Sydney Sininen: mfw different servers have different goals >:(((
9:54:37 | Funny Man haha: shounic dont worry chat is just being populated by actual brain damaged ppl rn
9:54:50 | Joshua Pinkham: being friendly is fine on the trenches server but not here
9:54:51 | 0scr_: bro 9 hours 
9:54:58 | herbert: whats a brain cell
9:54:59 | lostme: everything is black and white and inbetween stuff doesn't exist :shoArms:
9:55:08 | valerius0221: you want to test map. YOU ARE TESTING IT IN *REAL* ENV. go and ask people on map dot tf. there are round where 1 team looses cuz they go for funny strat instead of optimal. same for friendlies
9:55:11 | Václav Němec: this got off rails lmao
9:55:17 | 0scr_: idk about yall but imma go to bed
9:55:24 | Zerobrine: tf has chat become
9:55:27 | Jaden: this is an average shounic stream
9:55:27 | Inc0m1ng: night
9:55:37 | herbert: well if they are using funny strat instead of potimal they are still playing the game unlike friendlies
9:55:45 | literatemax: stream froze?
9:55:48 | Václav Němec: I think however if you see people under the map, the map probably isn't suitable for the server xd
9:55:52 | itchylol742: shounic died irl
9:55:52 | lostme: ded
9:56:01 | Dank Hank Hill: :face-blue-wide-eyes:
9:56:02 | herbert: shounic so eepy
9:56:03 | Jaden: heart attack
9:56:05 | Grogcito: shounic finally had a stroke
9:56:08 | pablito: my stremh
9:56:09 | Joshua Pinkham: i feel like at this point some people are just trolling and should be timed out
9:56:13 | valerius0221: oh no. we gave him a stroke :o
9:56:18 | lostme: alive jumpscare
9:56:19 | herbert: YOU'RE ALIVE
9:56:24 | Zerobrine: He's loading custom maps, it's hard for him to know if it's properly clipped or not, nothing he can do about it lol
9:56:26 | Zacco: me
9:56:37 | literatemax: they who, valve?
9:56:42 | Zacco: Like TF2 maps map tests?
9:56:47 | Zacco: that's where I test my maps
9:56:49 | herbert: money
9:56:55 | lostme: money
9:56:55 | Zacco: let me check
9:56:57 | Joshua Pinkham: money
9:57:02 | poopideeshroop: money
9:57:07 | literatemax: who is "they"
9:57:14 | Joshua Pinkham: big money
9:57:21 | 0scr_: things like game design?
9:57:26 | Lee Xuan: me. I am they/them.
9:57:27 | Zacco: somewhere here I believe
9:57:29 | herbert: $5 so much money
9:57:36 | Funny Man haha: alright I was just here to check in, have a good one shounic
9:57:45 | literatemax: seeya funny man
9:57:54 | Zacco: I'm not in your server :(
9:58:05 | herbert: server invite in description
9:58:22 | nss129: damn stream is still going fr
9:58:28 | nss129: shounic crazy man
9:58:29 | Zacco: that work?
9:58:30 | Davetrap: NOOOOO
9:58:31 | Xnery: ggs
9:58:31 | Davetrap: WHY
9:58:32 | nss129: no cap
9:58:34 | itchylol742: he killed us all
9:58:34 | Figo3: well that was fun
9:58:35 | Inc0m1ng: rip
9:58:39 | Dankermemer420: thank you shounic
9:58:41 | Sydney Sininen: That was fun
9:58:43 | Jaden: bye everyone!
9:58:47 | Joshua Pinkham: bye
9:58:47 | Xnery: that map was confusing
9:58:51 | herbert: no 10 hours :(
9:58:57 | Bradasparky: @valerius0221 Directly from the TF2maps #faq. Can I join a map test? "Remember that, while map testing may be fun, the primary focus is gameplay testing. Please don't "friendly" or run meme loadouts."
9:59:07 | Davetrap: i wanna learn hammer editor to make a 100 player map
9:59:21 | Batfoxkid: I was about to say, still going on?
9:59:21 | valerius0221: map testing usually involve ~10-15 people so there are no friendlies. but there are round where people fuck around and loose
9:59:44 | Davetrap: HE USES LIGHT MODE
9:59:46 | Davetrap: AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
9:59:54 | Zacco: that's where It is 
9:59:55 | Zacco: yup
10:00:01 | valerius0221: i am not
10:00:02 | woot000: hi guys
10:00:26 | valerius0221: 100 people and 10-15 server is different
10:00:47 | valerius0221: yep
10:00:53 | lostme: grog, what have you done...
10:00:54 | Bradasparky: The intention is to test maps. That doesn't change no matter how many players there are
10:00:55 | Zacco: bro that is 15%
10:00:58 | FridgeDuck: I also don't get how people would expect you to test for shit that people AREN'T doing.
10:01:05 | Xnery: valerius has never played in the trenches
10:01:09 | herbert: 10-15 people friendly or afk makes a diffference
10:01:12 | itchylol742: get ruthless mods to give a 24h ban to any friendlies
10:01:16 | Zacco: imagine 4 players in a 24 player server contributing nothing
10:01:19 | itchylol742: there must be blood
10:01:20 | Davetrap: we need 150 player servers so atleast 50 people can be friendly
10:01:21 | username_id: we cookin’?
10:01:22 | Lee Xuan: booooo everyone boo valurius booooooo
10:01:23 | 0scr_: that's how it would go irl
10:01:29 | GargantiN: damn i missed something? wha happend
10:01:30 | valerius0221: you don't have to listen to me if you don't want to
10:01:36 | woot000: 4 players in a 24 player server AFK'ing is just a typical valve casual server LOL
10:01:41 | Lee Xuan: boooooooo
10:01:42 | Jonny: yo how can i find your discord
10:01:47 | 0scr_: wdym all afk?
10:01:49 | Frost Byte: well i guess it works if your testing a trade map but thats it lol
10:01:50 | Grogcito: @lostme a little mischievousness
10:01:51 | Omni: don't people get kicked if they afk anyway like this doesn't make any sense
10:01:58 | valerius0221: we learn how map behaves in normal condition 
10:02:03 | Dankermemer420: i like friendlys and stuff, but testing maps on a test server is not the place
10:02:08 | woot000: i join chat for 1 minute and shounic is already considering quitting streaming
10:02:09 | Davetrap: valerius is attention seeking just ignore him
10:02:09 | woot000: it's so over
10:02:10 | Moncalf: classic loses argument "I didnt even care lol"
10:02:12 | SleepyEngi: it definitely makes a difference, but there isn't much you can do to "account for friendlies" within map design, besides not do funny rooms. You kinda just hope both teams have same number of friendli
10:02:14 | username_id: agreed
10:02:14 | valerius0221: normal condition involves friendlies
10:02:19 | herbert: @Jonny server invite in description
10:02:21 | Grogcito: valerious is on trial rn
10:02:31 | OblivionCreator: thanks shounic we all feel appreciated
10:02:33 | Lee Xuan: valerius more like vagina
10:02:36 | username_id: that mic
10:02:37 | Lee Xuan: haha
10:02:37 | Zacco: friendlies shouldn't be considered a "normal condition"
10:02:38 | Kalinka: he is still going
10:02:43 | Zerobrine: ye streaming sucks but it's fun when you have a chat that isn't giving you a mental breakdown lel
10:02:46 | valerius0221: @Davetrap :ok_hand:
10:02:56 | Joshua Pinkham: at this point some people should just be timed out
10:03:02 | Zacco: that's not what Valve thought normal conditions would be like when they released the game @valerius0221 
10:03:02 | SleepyEngi: like how would a map designer predict how many friendlies will be on each team
10:03:05 | Ak: yes
10:03:08 | banana bus boss: no
10:03:09 | literatemax: sounds like a challenge
10:03:11 | herbert: no
10:03:13 | username_id: no
10:03:13 | FloatlessKiwi: nope
10:03:15 | Zacco: absolutely not
10:03:16 | FridgeDuck: How the FUCK would you, is my question? If you INSIST on balancing around people who do nothing, HOW do you do that? That's really stupid.
10:03:18 | Dankermemer420: I cant even see how you could design a map to do that
10:03:23 | Omni: we've been talking about this for like half an hour, I woke up to this
10:03:24 | 0scr_: depends
10:03:25 | valerius0221: ok then i need help
10:03:32 | OblivionCreator: Yes *if* the map is like, trade_plaza
10:03:32 | banana bus boss: as someone who is currently, as we speak, making a map.
10:03:35 | Xnery: by balancing around an unbalanced matchup youre making the map unbalanced on balanced matchup
10:03:38 | European Fox: chat is this real
10:03:41 | banana bus boss: it is virtually impossible to test for something like this.
10:03:42 | 0scr_: i'd add this for a 100 player server
10:03:45 | pablito: it's not that deep
10:03:47 | Omni: shounic I think people are just trying to piss you off there's no other explaination
10:03:49 | Zacco: when you design a map you should design for how the game is INTENDED to be played
10:03:53 | SleepyEngi: what do you add to a map to make it "friendly accounted for" even
10:03:53 | herbert: a map designed to be winnable with friendlies would be unbalanced when people are taking it seriously
10:03:53 | Sydney Sininen: I think that if Blu has 25 AFK players and RED has a full team, then BLU should hve a chance at winning /s
10:03:54 | valerius0221: as you said i need help
10:04:01 | Gavin: shounic is getting trolled
10:04:02 | Grogcito: Why are you even questioning this lol, friendlies will play any map you give them no matter how shit it is
10:04:02 | Kalinka: dont public shame
10:04:07 | Dank Hank Hill: Bro go hop on a server made with friendlies in mind like a lazy pruple one
10:04:08 | valerius0221: gonna go and look for it
10:04:08 | OblivionCreator: wait I just realized what happened to the femboys
10:04:14 | meschfr: lol can you design a map where its balanced if one team is afk?
10:04:17 | FridgeDuck: @SleepyEngi That's what I'm sayin', how the fuck do you account for that shit
10:04:17 | literatemax: look for what
10:04:17 | Grogcito: I feel like shounic is descending into his insanity ark
10:04:24 | Zacco: valerius is about to go pull out pl_Shirfart_a1
10:04:28 | Royce Bracket: ban that guy
10:04:30 | Xnery: lmao laser focusing on semantics
10:04:32 | herbert: yooooooo 10 hours stream
10:04:32 | Xnery: youre a great guy
10:04:38 | (Verified) DEWILL: Yeet
10:04:39 | Davetrap: do a discord mod and ban him
10:04:40 | Zerobrine: man's about to show off a map he made when he was a fetus
10:04:42 | Joshua Pinkham: mods time that man out
10:04:42 | Batfoxkid: Man shounic losing his mind with chat. I think you need to end it here.
10:04:49 | woot000: what the fuck is happening 
10:04:50 | Grogcito: arc*
10:04:50 | Omni: ACHIEVEMENT IDLE SERVER ????
10:04:52 | Kalinka: The man is here
10:04:59 | Podpishik Nelisa: omfg 10 hours tf2 stream
10:05:09 | Davetrap: i think he left stream
10:05:10 | Davetrap: lol
10:05:10 | 0scr_: add a secret room for friendlies that kills anyone who deals damage in there
10:05:22 | valerius0221: "Royce Bracketban: that guy" i chose to disengage as disscotion got toxic
10:05:24 | Zacco: oh he totally just dipped
10:05:24 | HAL 9000: don't take people seriously on the internet
10:05:37 | Zerobrine: man's about to grab "achievement_engineer_v2" and it's just gonna be ass
10:05:42 | Zacco: bro left bc he had no argument lol
10:05:43 | SleepyEngi: now mappers have to add a "friendly room" that counts the friendly players and adds robots to that team to make up for missing players
10:05:50 | literatemax: well, hale health scales with players in the server, right? maybe a map could make use of that mechanic
10:05:56 | Dank Hank Hill: it's just one guys opinion over a majority disagreeing with him it's not worth arguing about this with him 
10:06:01 | Davetrap: he doesnt know hammer
10:06:04 | 0scr_: who is he talking to?
10:06:10 | 0scr_: oh
10:06:14 | herbert: have a room named "friendly room" but the room kills anyone who is in there longer than 10 seconds
10:06:18 | Grogcito: sho becomes asmongold and trials his viewers :pog:
10:06:20 | valerius0221: you are having bad mood because of it. so i don't want you to get even worse mood
10:06:22 | Horiuchi: every map should have a valve mandated daycare
10:06:26 | Doog: valerius sounds like my grandma
10:06:40 | OblivionCreator: friendlies are still in the server though @literatemax - you'd need to do something funky to track player damage/etc and then you risk accidentally counting bad players as friendlies
10:06:42 | Lee Xuan: valerius cringe :grimacing_face::flushed_face:
10:06:45 | igorka5. exe: we need to ban this guy 
10:06:50 | username_id: bros grabbing the receipt LOL 
10:06:55 | European Fox: ah the friendly debate, maybe we should discuss something less controversial like religion?
10:07:00 | literatemax: @valerius0221 rescind and retract or double down.
10:07:00 | woot000: i feel like i'm witnessing two people arguing in a different language but somehow i can hear both of them but still not understand a single word
10:07:02 | Davetrap: he said something wrong he knows its wrong he just doesnt wanna own up to it being wrong
10:07:08 | (Verified) DEWILL: Map should be designed based on the idea of power of both teams are equal. If you lose because you tried out wacky strat, it's unlikely due to map's fault
10:07:10 | SleepyEngi: this argument is dumb because you cant even account for friendlies, like what game mechanic could you use to count the number of friendlies
10:07:16 | Calamitery: friendlies are one ways of trolling, mapper design they map to be winnable to both team, if you really want a comp gameplay you need to ban friendlies
10:07:18 | herbert: idea to get rid of friendlies in testing: ban taunting
10:07:19 | pablito: ban him for what exactly lol
10:07:27 | Ak: it's impossible for a map maker to account for friendlies, if necessary a server has to do something
10:07:29 | literatemax: @OblivionCreator yeah thats a good point and goes back to what i was saying that there isnt an objective way to tell
10:07:47 | Kalinka: @dewill why did you stop uploading?
10:07:48 | Sydney Sininen: This feels like it's in the same vein as someone saying "a tier list doesn't matter because the better play will always win"
10:07:51 | Davetrap: i think there should be a bison soldier only map using vscript
10:07:55 | Davetrap: imagine the funny
10:08:03 | herbert: it would be funny
10:08:06 | Ak: in a normal server the ratio of friendlies to normal players is negligible, but it gets compounded to hell in 50v50
10:08:06 | Sydney Sininen: And it's always someone who doesn't understand how matchups or game design works
10:08:06 | 0scr_: depends on what kind of map we're building
10:08:09 | Hot Coffee Content: hi what is the stream still going
10:08:10 | OblivionCreator: cap speed changes depending on team dps, so if the other team does double your dps, your team gets double cap rate /j
10:08:12 | (Verified) DEWILL: If the mapper makes a map empowering one side too much in a case of pubstomping, in the match when both team is equally powered, will end up too one-sided
10:08:13 | Davetrap: 5 cp
10:08:25 | 0scr_: is it just another shitpost maps or something serious?
10:08:34 | (Verified) DEWILL: Gotta be one of the silliest arguement over the map design so far I've heard
10:08:37 | Davetrap: @OblivionCreator wtf are you yapping about bto
10:08:40 | Xnery: serious i hope
10:08:47 | FridgeDuck: There's no universe in which balancing a map other than under the condition of perfectly equal teams is at all practical
10:08:55 | igorka5. exe: no way DEWILL
10:08:55 | Dankermemer420: ^
10:08:55 | European Fox: off topic I think the cat is cute
10:08:56 | Zerobrine: :face-blue-wide-eyes:
10:09:00 | valerius0221: medieval mode exist with silly limits. so if you have a way to inforce those rules during normal game then yes
10:09:02 | SleepyEngi: how do you balance a map against friendlies its not even possible
10:09:05 | OblivionCreator: @Davetrap the /j indicates it's a joke
10:09:13 | woot000: Just get chatgpt to balance your tf2 maps. problem solved forever
10:09:15 | igorka5. exe: first its the solar light then its DEWILL
10:09:15 | Hot Coffee Content: i went to sleep woke up and came back to see the livestream still there
10:09:20 | username_id: we live in a society :pensive_face:
10:09:20 | Xnery: lol
10:09:28 | Grogcito: Yo we reached the 10 hour mark
10:09:29 | itchylol742: we live in a shociety :3
10:09:34 | Omni: how do you enforce some people being friendlies
10:09:35 | Joshua Pinkham: i think at this point some people deserve to get banned
10:09:36 | Xnery: end the stream while we're on a high note
10:09:41 | Davetrap: shounic how is the youtube chat map going
10:09:42 | herbert: solarlight was in the stream at one point?
10:09:43 | Zerobrine: I joined da discord anywho
10:09:50 | 0scr_: who are you?
10:09:53 | Ak: yeah solar was here
10:09:56 | 0scr_: where's shounic?
10:09:56 | European Fox: this was like the teacher asking if you want toshare your gum with the class
10:09:57 | username_id: im me
10:10:01 | Xnery: @Davetrap theres a discord server for it
10:10:03 | FloatlessKiwi: maybe his reasoning was to include every variable of types of players in creating a map???
10:10:10 | Zerobrine: i'll try to consistantly join streams
10:10:18 | Zerobrine: emphasis on try 
10:10:22 | Davetrap: @Xnery i am not going on discord
10:10:29 | Sydney Sininen: Go eat dinner or something man
10:10:30 | itchylol742: byebye :3
10:10:31 | 0scr_: friendly room 
10:10:32 | SleepyEngi: what map design could you do to account for someone who stands afk doing nothing lol
10:10:34 | Zerobrine: :waving_hand:
