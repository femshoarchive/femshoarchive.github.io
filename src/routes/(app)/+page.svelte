<h2 class="mt-0">Welcome!</h2>
This page is basically a gallery with <i>all</i> FemSho art made thus far!

<h2>Who the hell is FemSho?</h2>
FemSho is a character originally drawn by <a class="italic underline underline-offset-auto" href="https://twitter.com/pompmaker1">Pompmaker1</a> based on <a class="italic underline underline-offset-auto" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHlTEt24Yb4ylJFuWz7hXIw">Shounic's</a> (<a class="italic underline underline-offset-auto" href="/andyherdscomics.webp">not</a>) original character, Shocat but drawn as a femboy. Why is this such a big deal? Like a month later since that artwork was drawn, <a class="italic underline underline-offset-auto" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUnDDhXzfasuvzEZfO09nYw">Delta Time</a> and other people persuaded Shounic into using FemSho as his PNGTuber avatar with the power of $700.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
The website's made with <a class="italic underline underline-offset-auto" href="https://kit.svelte.dev">SvelteKit</a>, TypeScript and <a class="italic underline underline-offset-auto" href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a>. Despite of everything being made with modern web technologies, its still somewhat close to regular HTML and JavaScript. .svelte files are basically small snippets of HTML other pages can include and Tailwind is basically a collection of standardized CSS classes which you use instead of separate CSS styles. Despite of what it sounds like its very useful, especially in regards to stuff like themes and animations. And TypeScript is basically JavaScript with types. If you don't feel all that comfortable with them just send a pull request on GitHub with what you made so far and I'll integrate it properly and whatnot.
