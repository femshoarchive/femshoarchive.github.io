            This site contains has related to FemShoe, from stream archives to art made by pompmaker1, even the new video "sumarizing" everything made by Delta Time!
            I even sumarized every donation made to the Femboy Fund&#8482.

            <p class="title">FAQ</p>
            <p class="question">Q: Why did you make this site?</p>
            <strong>A:</strong> When I initialy started making this site I didn't know Shounic has a stream archive playlist and when I did, throwing everything out would've been a waste of effort so fuck it. And I also think I did a pretty good job designing everything.

            <p class="question">Q: Why aren't you just using YouTube embeds?</p>
            <strong>A:</strong> Basically same thing as the last anwser, had few streams downloaded on my phone since I didn't know about that playlist and that would've also been a waste of effort. "But what if Shounic decides to delete these VODs"... Yeah, fuck it.

            <p class="question">Q: Why aren't you using [Framework Name Here] / Why is your code a fucking mess?</p>
            <strong>A:</strong> I'm not a web developer, alright? I do not need any bloat or JavaScript where it's not necesary for such a simple site. I made this site for <strong>fun</strong> and not to make money.
