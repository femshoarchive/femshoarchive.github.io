34:59 | S0fti: I love cock
35:01 | Jole: oh wait you started 30 min ago nvm
35:01 | Ozvoid: Long choke points are fun if they have good cover and small flanks. So, I guess, no? @Hue Manatee 
35:05 | maksu: maybe you can arrange a map making contest instead?
35:20 | Hamsik: whats with the femboy avatar?
35:23 | Inkblot: elements?
35:24 | Stoneblackdog: you're a femboy?
35:30 | linguini15: when you use the quick fix and randomly get launched at 1 billion ups to the other side of the map while spread healing
35:30 | Hammerfell: @Ghostler we love femboy shounic
35:32 | dojodog: there's a lot of push and pull because of the different people designing the map imo
35:33 | Ultra 598: Someone bribed shounic
35:40 | Keegan Kopas: how many of these are you gonna do?
35:41 | Lasag: YOOOO I'M OFF TO SD_DOOMSDAY

36:14 | TheLetterZed: pl_ideasguy
36:20 | Ghostler: 700 is worth it fr
36:31 | PatGaming: yeah
36:35 | Egg Binary: can you repeat that
36:36 | Infinite Mausoleum: Yes, but also consider: ctf_convoy just copypasted directly into the middle of the map.
36:38 | AlrexX extras: might need some team filtered spawn teles
36:38 | lostme: just have people submit their maps, sure
36:41 | Ghostler: yeah i'm surely listening
36:41 | Hammerfell: holy shit this part looks crazy
36:42 | Ghostler: dw
36:42 | AlrexX extras: yeah that ideas cool btw
36:42 | siw: map is based on biomes ?
36:46 | Worstcase: sounds like you want to look at community made maps?
36:51 | Splatana: Why does this even finish with a pyramid
36:53 | Keegan Kopas: so like an amatuer hour for mappers?
36:53 | Egg Binary: can you repeat that
36:58 | Super Sain: no we're not listening
37:04 | poop bagel: The shounic femboy model is cute.
37:08 | AlrexX extras: WHY IS THERE A MINI SPIRE LOOL
37:11 | Ghostler: yeah we're not listening because we're too focused on the femboy
37:20 | WaiGee: am not listening, distracted by the femboy

37:26 | SUPDOZ: ok
37:27 | AlrexX extras: that sounds fun
37:29 | pyroskark: I feel like they need someone to lead that
37:33 | The Omega: femboy
37:40 | Ghostler: hmm
37:44 | GamerOnTheInternet: lmao hes still a femboy
37:46 | pyroskark: otherwise it would get lost in whateverness
37:50 | AlrexX extras: i'd love to contribute to a system like that
38:02 | Keegan Kopas: custom map amateur hour 
38:06 | AkiyamaIsEpic: woah why do you sound so alive
38:06 | Bobo: what the hell are you yappin about :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face:

38:55 | Ghostler: CHILL
39:04 | TheLetterZed: @shounic you should do like gamejams for maps like this
39:06 | Jaden: @FrostedGeulleisia is onto something
39:10 | Bobo: where is the family guy clips and subway surfers footage?!?!?!! :pouting_face::pouting_face::pouting_face::pouting_face:
39:34 | Ghostler: nah the femboy is enough incentive to listen to him
39:35 | seamuskills: interesting idea
39:35 | Retro blue: I say go for it
39:36 | Yeti's Mods: wait start over :)
39:36 | Mr. Tatortot: seems lunatical
39:37 | WaiGee: did you say something?
39:37 | AlrexX extras: i think that's awesome
39:37 | Egg Binary: can you repeat that
39:39 | werecat: 100 players on 24 players maps is fun though
39:39 | PatGaming: I think it’s brilliant
39:40 | Ozvoid: I like the idea.
39:41 | Jaden: Haven’t you pitched that idea before
39:41 | Doog: sounds amazing shou
39:42 | Bobo: 0/10 no family guy clips
39:44 | AkiyamaIsEpic: go
39:45 | endarkenedgd: this map is horrible lmfao
39:46 | Worstcase: it sounds like a lot of fun provided the critique is constructive
39:46 | Billy: Depends on how many mappers u got
39:47 | Ghostler: yeah go for it
39:49 | Brattleborg: sounds cool
39:50 | DrTerror: Honestly could work
39:50 | · FrostedGeulleisia: @Jaden best part is that it already exists on the workshop
39:55 | lostme: thumb up
39:57 | Jaden: Regardless I think it’s a good idea
40:00 | DrTerror: too much stress for you doesnt come out well in the long term
40:04 | dojodog: i think it's a better way of doing things
40:04 | pyroskark: it needs community member leaders to keep it organized and for progress to do it
40:06 | Ghostler: I genuenly listened even tho I didn't understand like 80% of it :thumbs_up:
40:07 | Crimpso: i like it since people like helping
40:08 | Inc0m1ng: I wouldn't take part in it but I like the idea of people making maps with the drawings people post on discord
40:09 | LoyalDevotee17: I found the pyramid sex lol
40:11 | DrTerror: the stress will come from you overworking yourseklf
40:12 | Hue Manatee: i kinda just hope 100 players is a gamemode people really take up so you dont have to be the head of everything
40:12 | Keegan Kopas: shounic when are you gonna drop the 100 player family guy back to the multiverse co-op server
40:14 | AkiyamaIsEpic: why does this dude suddenly sound alive
40:15 | Infinite Mausoleum: Sounds pretty good, but also yeah appoint a community leader or smth
40:15 | Inc0m1ng: It would be fun to test them
40:21 | AkiyamaIsEpic: did i miss character development
40:24 | Rayman33: yeah a good idea :thumbs_up:
40:25 | Crimpso: i listened but im drawing so i forgot everything
40:29 | Ozvoid: Be like valve, accept the community's submissions and add it to the official pool.
40:30 | Ghostler: "WHY DOES HE SUDDENLY SOUND ALIVE" LOL
40:33 | pilly nutty: will there be people willing to map out someone's ideas
40:34 | Ghostler: THAT'S CRAZY
40:38 | Hue Manatee: like if i was into mapping id just independently make my own 100player map for the heck of it 
40:47 | Mr. Tatortot: so what tf2 maps does ?
40:51 | Ghostler: @AkiyamaIsEpic did you think he was an AI?
41:03 | siw: bro shounic is not real you know that right

41:21 | Czechboy: dispenser congregation
41:24 | Emergence: how do arena maps work with the trenches?
41:36 | FreeAndLit: i think carrier should be remove from the treches
41:47 | AkiyamaIsEpic: caber
41:47 | Inc0m1ng: wouldn't the steam workshop be better for people to post their map ideas for the 100 player server and put it in a playlist?
41:48 | AkiyamaIsEpic: insane
41:48 | Jaden: YES
41:50 | 「Vlavich」: do you think this is balanced?
41:51 | maksu: honestly? not bad
41:57 | DrTerror: Carrier is so broken 
42:00 | DrTerror: its like turbine but worse
42:00 | Ghostler: bro half of the chat is just being so gay
42:01 | AlrexX extras: ctf trenches :fire:
42:07 | Ghostler: y'all gotta hold yourselves
42:07 | InsecureBroccoli: We should make an arena map then
42:12 | (Moderator) Glaceon XIX: I enjoyed the halloween arena map with the buffs that each team could vote on
42:14 | · FrostedGeulleisia: but yeah, ctf_half2forthalfturbine is a thing, would solve the issue with some people being pro-2fort and others being pro-turbine
42:18 | linguini15: i just clipped through that arch bridge
42:21 | Hue Manatee: i wish people played arena more :/
42:22 | Worstcase: based
42:22 | Rayman33: why you don't add MVM maps or it's bad idea??
42:24 | Laser ‎ Bean: dont remove it tho
42:32 | · FrostedGeulleisia: oh also on carrier we had games which legit timed out because blue kept healing the giant lmao
42:33 | DrTerror: Please fix it in your own time, if its gonna be fixed then its a relief
42:39 | Ghostler: mvm maps sound like they're gonna have some problems
42:42 | Hue Manatee: i played on a 2fort arena server wayyy back in the day and it had a really unique appeal
42:44 | AkiyamaIsEpic: you ate my barber
42:51 | Jole: i'm all for spamfests but 1 hour of carrier can get boring
42:51 | Ghostler: you ain't my father
42:53 | Bobo: why is that bridge so yellow? who pissed on It??
43:00 | Ghostler: sniper
43:01 | Ozvoid: We should all collectively remake turbine to be good
43:02 | Ghostler: he did
43:04 | Ghostler: a lot
43:04 | AlrexX extras: oh yeah fighting around that corner is so fun for no reason
43:12 | PatGaming: do you know where I should go if I want to learn how to make maps for tf2?
43:12 | Hue Manatee: YES

43:43 | Ozvoid: Agreed
43:49 | AkiyamaIsEpic: the hell is a team fortress 2
43:50 | Cluzzy32: i dont think my computer can ahndle this
43:50 | Hue Manatee: there should be a 100 player map thats just one big chokepoint i would unironically love it
43:51 | WaiGee: thats just a femboy in their natrual habitat
43:55 | DrTerror: You should add 50 nukes to balance this map tbh
43:55 | AkiyamaIsEpic: i thought this was half life 2
43:56 | A Blue Nebula: juice galaxy morningstar only is the hardest challenge ever and i made it up
43:58 | DrTerror: thats my take
44:12 | AlrexX extras: i'm seeing lots of sightlines that could be exploited by a good sightline idk
44:12 | A Blue Nebula: I might be going insane
44:21 | Ghostler: the map looks confusing as hell
44:21 | lostme: nothing can be worse than dbz :)
44:21 | PatGaming: We should just make an actual trench for one of the maps
44:21 | dojodog: yea sniper has some good sightlines but they don't seem too powerful
44:29 | A Blue Nebula: The morningstar is the first weapon in juice galaxy
44:31 | AlrexX extras: oh my god i want to artpass this shit it's gonna be so funny
44:36 | AkiyamaIsEpic: I LOVE EGYPT!
44:41 | Yeti's Mods: 1984

44:46 | AlrexX extras: if it were my choice i'd turn the pyramid into a mayan one
44:47 | Bobo: make It egypt themed
44:49 | WaiGee: vegas pyramid
44:49 | AlrexX extras: LOL hi
44:51 | A Blue Nebula: make this forest themed
44:52 | Ghostler: lol
44:53 | A Blue Nebula: now
44:57 | S0fti: Honestly, autumn themed map would go hard. we slap a few waterfalls in here, orange and yellow, it'd look good
45:06 | · FrostedGeulleisia: i'm just glaceon
45:08 | · FrostedGeulleisia: :)
45:11 | Ghostler: forest themed with the pyramid being like an astec building? 
45:17 | pilly nutty: make it a floridian swamp and the pyramid into a bass pro shop
45:19 | Ghostler: that would be cool
45:19 | lostme: alrexx are you ok? did dbz leave brain damage?
45:22 | Ozvoid: Don't do Egypt, but do Team Fortress Classic dustbowl themed. High-tech mixed with canyon wasteland.
45:23 | Ghostler: astec temple or wtv
45:27 | Rayman33: how about 100 player dodgeball???
45:33 | A Blue Nebula: ye
45:34 | Ghostler: nah make it amazon themed

46:00 | WaiGee: thats actually a really good idea
46:00 | TheLetterZed: Ooh cool, Magic: the Gathering had a designer search that had a quiz like that
46:06 | Ghostler: I heard ppl say that it was 700 idk tho

1:13:17 | Ghostler: yeah i'm gonna draw it rn
1:13:20 | n0kla: It was an obvious lie, if there was any, it would be immediately sprayed everywhere to get stream banned
1:13:36 | AlrexX extras: i feel like we're gonna have to section off areas better to help performance, looks really open rn so idk if source's spaghetti is gonna like it when it's fully detailed

1:15:32 | круглый: based
1:15:44 | Harki: probably not fun to play with these much playerss 
1:15:49 | Bobo: does your pyro has the pyrocinical mod??
1:16:05 | DrTerror: I think its not obvious enough and it isnt a very secret or safe route 
1:16:12 | Just Groove: its always a femboy...
1:16:12 | Pompmaker1: shounic's femboy feet are not horror, they are lovely
1:16:15 | Just Groove: jesus christ
1:16:17 | Just Groove: ..............
1:16:23 | Normal Human: do you have any predictions for 64 bit release
1:16:24 | DrTerror: its better than left side at least
1:16:36 | DrTerror: I feel like arrows or stairs with a door 
1:16:37 | Harki: heavy jumpscare
1:16:39 | DrTerror: yeah exactly
1:16:42 | DrTerror: that works well
1:16:43 | Ghostler: ok no yeah I found a way better reference picture

1:16:57 | Bobo: If your feet isnt horrors and traumas show us :face_savoring_food::face_savoring_food::face_savoring_food:
1:16:58 | DrTerror: they need a strategic advantage so the overhang works better
1:17:12 | dednaught: i'm not a femboy the paid a lot :doubt:
1:17:28 | Normal Human: the potted plant doing gods work 🙏🏿🙏🏿:speaking_head::speaking_head:
1:17:39 | WaiGee: bless the potted plant
1:17:44 | dojodog: do you think the scottish resistance thing was a genuine bug or they just forgot to change the model back to the syringe when testing lol
1:18:13 | dojodog: oh, interesting
1:18:25 | n0kla: what are your thoughts on how Fall of Troy influenced Myconeaen Greece and furthered its demise from already ongoing Bronze Age collapse?
1:18:25 | Normal Human: what about the airblast being smaller?
1:18:28 | Super Sain: @Ghostler wdym?
1:18:33 | Inc0m1ng: you're smarter than most of us
1:18:37 | Chillyroll: then uh... get smarter
1:18:50 | Funny Man haha: ur a femboy now????????
1:18:57 | Inc0m1ng: fair fair
1:18:59 | Bobo: can you do 1+1:trade_mark: ?
1:19:04 | Ghostler: @Super Sain because I had like a picture of the drawing in my head but I wasn't finding a good reference picture
1:19:14 | Mr. Tatortot: only hardcore pyro mains will notice
1:19:15 | Ghostler: but now I found a perfect one and the anatomy seems good
1:19:18 | dojodog: even with how much i play pyro i wouldnt mind a smaller airblast radius
1:19:21 | Funny Man haha: this map kinda stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:19:26 | DrTerror: That was kinda fun
1:19:29 | DrTerror: for red
1:19:30 | werecat: rip server

1:19:42 | dojodog: Rome wasn't built in a day (:
1:19:43 | Aw Man: ggs
1:19:43 | SleepyEngi: map would have been better with more bugs
1:19:43 | Dan: red rules blu drools
1:19:44 | Pixell: red is too op
1:19:49 | ButtonMasher: Make the pillars nobuild
1:19:51 | maksu: 2nd point gets captured too fast
1:19:51 | Mr. Tatortot: kinda open ngl
1:19:51 | Ghostler: do I leave my discord here for y'all who want the drawing later?
1:19:54 | Some Random Dude: Needs underwater room like that one on pier
1:19:55 | lostme: dbz was perfect instantly, wdym
1:19:55 | Pixell: nerf red
1:19:59 | Funny Man haha: make it buggier
1:19:59 | Super Sain: nooo
1:20:00 | n0kla: 4 dabloons for a shouboy 3d model
1:20:02 | Overseer: literal bugs like spiders and cockroaches
1:20:03 | Funny Man haha: so itll be funny
1:20:04 | Some Random Dude: lower ceiling
1:20:06 | dojodog: im gonna go take note of some weird spots
1:20:08 | SleepyEngi: i mean, it would have been more interesting lol
1:20:12 | WaiGee: @Ghostler yes
1:20:14 | LoolFR: also you can just from a spawn look into the other spawn, pretty screwed up for snipers
1:20:15 | Aw Man: the spawn thing makes it impossible to defend 2nd 
1:20:15 | Anri: is this still going?
1:20:17 | Ghostler: alr
1:20:21 | Funny Man haha: just make it buggier and shittier tbh and it'll be forgiven
1:20:23 | Ghostler: ghostler__
1:20:26 | Egg Binary: remove the pyramid and replace it with a spiral
1:20:26 | dermitio: river
1:20:28 | Normal Human: this map reminds me of lost izalith
1:20:31 | Joshua Pinkham: the first point it was too deep 
1:20:33 | Ghostler: it's my name and two "_"
1:20:36 | smol brendan: sentries on rocks feels a bit strong
1:20:36 | dkz: sightlines
1:20:38 | Some Random Dude: more corners and cover
1:20:39 | Entropy: sightlines
1:20:39 | Единорог Серёжа: add Fortnite
1:20:40 | maksu: the red spawn is too close to the point
1:20:40 | Krackin Gibbs: my current complaints: too flat (like a box with stuff in it), sniper hell, long respawn time, bs doors by last
1:20:41 | Mold: why is he a vtuber now
1:20:41 | TheDesaj2: add cover for Blu.
1:20:43 | (New member) Shindlers Pist: less cover for red near the point
1:20:43 | Stolen Comment Corp.: fix the sightline problem
1:20:45 | Mr. Tatortot: the sightline from blu spawn over the bridge
1:20:46 | Adamwal W: longer distance from spawn
1:20:46 | Funny Man haha: move the red spawn further away from the first point, lower respawn time for blu
1:20:47 | Joshua Pinkham: you have to walk a long distance to get to the first point
1:20:48 | Metbol: move spawn away
1:20:49 | Bobo: point 1 sucks ahh to capture
1:20:51 | Personaless: Spawns are pretty bad all around the map
1:20:51 | Dankermemer420: move first point to the red hut?
1:20:52 | LoolFR: sightlines are screwed up
1:20:52 | Doog: it seems a bit hard to walk over to point a
1:20:52 | Hydro Eclipse: giving blu a way to reach the flank without crossing the main sightline
1:20:53 | noktoh: too much water
1:20:56 | BabyCola: sightlines are advantagous out of blu spawn for red
1:20:58 | ButtonMasher: Just put a rock in front of the big sightlines
1:20:58 | Bruva Crispy: move the point up
1:20:59 | AlrexX extras: too open maybe
1:20:59 | Pompmaker1: add a literal overarching platform that archs over the battlefield
1:21:01 | Funny Man haha: red spawn is literally Sniffing That First Point Taint tbh
1:21:01 | Pixell: red too close to point
1:21:01 | Egg Binary: I couldn't do anything as heavy without headshot death
1:21:04 | dojodog: is there a channel/bot where I can address some issues I found
1:21:05 | Aw Man: the spawning thing makes red impossible to defend 2nd point
1:21:08 | Pixell: make map larger
1:21:12 | TheDesaj2: long respawn times, sightlines and
1:21:16 | werecat: 20 second respawn on blu
1:21:24 | 𝙳𝚒𝚟𝚒𝚜𝚒𝚟𝚎𝟿: femboy? 
1:21:26 | The Great Wizard: there should be a path to flank without going into water 
1:21:27 | Super Sain: grenade spam
1:21:30 | DrTerror: the upwards area on the right side should have a blockade, or holes for spamming for blu 
1:21:31 | Source engine Gamer 1000: i cant join
1:21:32 | LoolFR: blu also got a 12 second respawn time, that is not ok
1:21:33 | Harsha: Make the first point closer to blu spawn
1:21:37 | Pixell: increase object limit
1:21:41 | Jackson Shipmun: the sightline /into spawn/ in particular is too long
1:21:42 | Some Random Dude: blu need better sightlines on first with cover near spawn to make spam less effective
1:21:45 | Source engine Gamer 1000: ohrip
1:21:48 | lostme: wth why am I doing the work
1:21:50 | Hydro Eclipse: blu needs a way to reach the flank route without a need to cross the sightline
1:21:59 | Robert Stegmann: It feels like one big choke point as red. Unless you blast jump, you have three exits and they all face the same way
1:22:14 | BabyCola: when blu gets close enough they can spawnkill out of a red door
1:22:15 | Bobo: not enough cover for BLU trash sightlines and RED too close to the points
1:22:18 | LoolFR: the no's are sniper mains
1:22:19 | Source engine Gamer 1000: im a new guy to tf2 i exploit sometimes btw, i wont exploit during this live
1:22:19 | Свят iRo: I think the first 2 points should be easy for the blue ones, and difficult for the last ones
1:22:20 | tommya: Sniper hate
1:22:22 | Metbol: sniper in 100 player is not as oppresive
1:22:22 | Billy: aint nobody defending snipers
1:22:25 | D1V1S: idk I just joined lol
1:22:26 | Some Random Dude: demo sightlines need fixing
1:22:28 | Pixell: extend the map
1:22:29 | Pompmaker1: can we?
1:22:29 | Михаил Вылегжанин: ааа im late
1:22:36 | dermitio: too open
1:22:36 | SleepyEngi: the "spiral of hell" area turned out to be completely nothing, capped in 10 seconds
1:22:42 | dojodog: I haven't found much issues while playing sniper
1:22:44 | Robert Stegmann: They are too long and too many
1:22:46 | The Great Wizard: red box to first bridge 
1:22:47 | BabyCola: lots of sniper lines everywhere
1:22:49 | LoolFR: you can shoot directly into blue's spawn from very far
1:22:50 | MN: the map is just super fucking FLAT
1:22:51 | Egg Binary: definetly
1:22:51 | Cosmic Cat: I never like getting randomly machina body shot from somewhere I couldn't see
1:22:52 | DrTerror: There is barely any cover from spawn so engis cant consolidate 
1:22:52 | Some Random Dude: give the bridge sides
1:22:52 | BabyCola: orange ramp
1:22:53 | LoolFR: that is scerwed up
1:22:54 | dojodog: the pillars do a pretty good job in the first area
1:22:57 | Super Sain: explosive spam is a nightmare
1:22:57 | Harsha: Make the first point inside the red box
1:22:58 | somehow a wizard: the gig-long lines are the problem
1:22:58 | maksu: i personally didn't have much of a problem with snipers on this map for some reason
1:22:59 | Normal Human: 85% :skull:
1:23:01 | Egg Binary: red box was a death trap to snipers
1:23:03 | The Great Wizard: the one you are on 
1:23:06 | FridgeDuck: A "bad sniper sightline" would be one where there's no flank to contest it without running into another sightline
1:23:08 | Source engine Gamer 1000: whats ur opinion on tf2 friendlies
1:23:17 | Hydro Eclipse: a red sniper taking the flank to their own side can see all the way to the bridge
1:23:17 | Pixell: make the map larger
1:23:18 | Robert Stegmann: You have to cross like 3 or 4 sightlines
1:23:24 | dermitio: make that a gate
1:23:29 | Stolen Comment Corp.: i saw a sightline that goes straight to red spawn
1:23:35 | TheDesaj2: this is like Venice sightlines on steroids.
1:23:36 | ButtonMasher: Just add a fence in front of blue spawn
1:23:37 | DrTerror: Blue doesnt have any cover from sniper and projectile spam, they only can on right side and its not useful for pushing because its too far from the point
1:23:39 | Some Random Dude: give the bridge more of a curve
1:23:45 | dermitio: yes
1:23:49 | Pixell: give blu 2 capture points 1 normal point and 2 red points
1:23:50 | Normal Human: put a shut door
1:23:57 | 𝙳𝚒𝚟𝚒𝚜𝚒𝚟𝚎𝟿: did u make this map? 
1:24:00 | dermitio: ehhh
1:24:04 | Ozvoid: we need more cover.
1:24:10 | Some Random Dude: maybe just make the side bit further right
1:24:10 | maksu: make the bridge steeper
1:24:14 | Свят iRo: I think the first 2 points should be easy for the blue ones, and difficult for the last ones
1:24:15 | Robert Stegmann: Have the ramp loop around into the box
1:24:17 | ponyrider: ayo my favourite femboy vtuber is live
1:24:18 | LoolFR: put some things ON the bridge like boxes and shit
1:24:20 | dermitio: just remove the ramp
1:24:28 | Vivid Hut 64: femboy shounic has done irreparable damage to the stream 
1:24:28 | maksu: make the bridge so steep it blocks the sighline
1:24:32 | Some Random Dude: maybe if the ramp led straight into that room opposite it
1:24:34 | Drooled HPSK: who drew the femboy funny pic?
1:24:34 | gryffinp: Can you code a killbox that only kills snipers
1:24:36 | Ben Foster: remove snipers : D
1:24:36 | werecat: maybe add a flank for blu to access that side building
1:24:36 | dermitio: yea
1:24:39 | dermitio: you dont
1:24:39 | smol brendan: stairs
1:24:44 | werecat: the side building after the bridge
1:24:46 | Stolen Comment Corp.: put a wall outside blue spawn
1:24:46 | AppleCake PizzaWaffle: make a overpass that cover the sight line
1:24:47 | Source engine Gamer 1000: hey shounic, the funniest video that made me laugh seeing it was the sniper eating his gun
1:24:50 | Super Sain: add some more flank hallways
1:24:54 | Robert Stegmann: change it to a ladder
1:24:55 | Super Sain: or paths
1:24:56 | Hydro Eclipse: give blu a way to reach the flank without having to cross the bridge sightline. Maybe a extra route that exits the red building that's isn't used that much
1:24:57 | gryffinp: Can you cover the map in a killbox that only kills snipers
1:25:04 | FridgeDuck: Instead of ramping into the wide open, make that ramp lead into a room that takes you to a closer flank or something
1:25:08 | dojodog: there's a spot where you can't get through because the collider is too large at "3005.10 -3256.99 180.48", but engies can still place buildings there
1:25:10 | MN: the map is just super fucking FLAT
1:25:15 | DrTerror: Extend the upward sightline on the left side and connect it to the former ramp, make a door for blu and they can flank there
1:25:15 | Pompmaker1: hey shounic, the funniest video that made me laugh seeing it was any class using any weapon
1:25:30 | dermitio: fixed.
1:25:36 | Robert Stegmann: Put a ladder brush
1:25:44 | Some Random Dude: turn it into a waterfall? or river?
1:25:46 | LoyalDevotee17: this maybe a dumb question but that is hammer 3.4 correct?
1:25:53 | maksu: how about making the bridge higher?
1:25:56 | dermitio: or make it all higher ?
1:26:00 | LoyalDevotee17: noted thank you
1:26:02 | Bobo: bruh
1:26:03 | Normal Human: make the wall longer
1:26:06 | smol brendan: extend a rock to the side?
1:26:08 | Stolen Comment Corp.: maybe put a wall on the blue side before the bridge
1:26:09 | Some Random Dude: if you put water which pushes you it will make sniping far more difficult
1:26:09 | Bobo: hate*
1:26:10 | dojodog: Is there a command to show the player's collision hull?
1:26:11 | Bobo: Just a single hate?
1:26:15 | lostme: slap a wall in the middle of the bridge :shocrossedarms:
1:26:17 | dermitio: make it all higher and add a roof to the bridge
1:26:18 | Robert Stegmann: place a wall, and to leave the ramp you have to go through red building
1:26:22 | Hydro Eclipse: the red building near the flank in the corner isn't used much. maybe make it an extra route that doesn't expose blu to the sightlines?
1:26:39 | FridgeDuck: Could you extend that wall that's in front of it to cover all the way to that red room, and then make the red room have a passage that leads you closer to blu
1:26:42 | maksu: is making the bridge really steep a dumb idea?
1:26:46 | DrTerror: Make a door that enters the blu ramp so both sides are safe enough from snipers, either that or make a middle ground so the spawn room is blocked
1:26:52 | Attack Walrus: you should add a battlepass
1:26:54 | Some Random Dude: maybe even add a train that goes through occasionally to make camping as sniper spicy
1:27:00 | Robert Stegmann: yeah, red building could be an exit from blu spawn
1:27:05 | Normal Human: why do you have a choker on
1:27:06 | Ghostler: OK i'm done with the sketch
1:27:08 | Source engine Gamer 1000: whats ur opinion on tf2 children?
1:27:13 | Ghostler: he's a femboy
1:27:20 | smol brendan: YES
1:27:21 | Cosmic Cat: YES
1:27:23 | dermitio: ooh
1:27:24 | smol brendan: dustbowl tunnel
1:27:26 | dermitio: I like it
1:27:30 | Cosmic Cat: it would be so funny
1:27:31 | LoolFR: that would be a sniper farm
1:27:32 | Ghostler: I just drew femboy shounic hehe
1:27:34 | tommya: Tunnel tunnel tunnel
1:27:37 | Михаил Вылегжанин: Wow guys are u so serios there wow
1:27:41 | Hydro Eclipse: insted of an exit out of blu, just make it an extra route
1:27:43 | TheDesaj2: yes
1:27:44 | FridgeDuck: You could CONNECT it to blu spawn with a winding tunnel though
1:27:45 | DrTerror: Its perfectly safe for blu then, but a lot of designs can be done there
1:27:47 | Cosmic Cat: tunnel tunnel tunnel
1:27:50 | Some Random Dude: add flowing water to push snipers
1:27:53 | Stolen Comment Corp.: put a wall on the blue side
1:28:05 | Ghostler: yep
1:28:08 | Ghostler: just like minecraft
1:28:10 | Joshua Pinkham: keep the ramp add the tunnel
1:28:10 | Super Sain: minecraft sniper farm
1:28:16 | Metbol: extend red building
1:28:18 | ponyrider: tunnel
1:28:19 | Mr. Tatortot: add a hill in between those two rocks that blu can walk over 
1:28:24 | FridgeDuck: I say side tunnel from red room
1:28:24 | Ghostler: super sain do you still want to see the sketch?
1:28:24 | Some Random Dude: pretty much like minecraft
1:28:27 | Ghostler: i'm done sketching so
1:28:29 | AlrexX extras: probably gonna need to move here the bridge is altogether
1:28:30 | Pompmaker1: the flowing water is a genius idea actually
1:28:32 | Ghostler: it should be good enough to look at
1:28:35 | D1V1S: bottomless pit so they can't peek around the corner?
1:28:39 | Свят iRo: make the bridge higher and then the exit will not be visible
1:28:41 | Personaless: Can we send you ideas in image form?
1:28:41 | Source engine Gamer 1000: yo shounic whats ur opinion on tf2 children?
1:28:43 | dermitio: can work
1:28:45 | jokerofspades: so im assuming the femboy fund won
1:28:46 | Harsha: Add crocodiles at that sniper spot
1:28:46 | Pompmaker1: you should do the flowing water, that sounds amazing
1:28:49 | Inc0m1ng: that could work
1:28:50 | Super Sain: @Ghostler yes
1:28:50 | lostme: good
1:28:53 | Robert Stegmann: you still have to cross other sniper site lones
1:28:53 | Nerd0047: Femboy is femback
1:28:55 | AlrexX extras: sounds good
1:28:55 | DrTerror: or exit from below so they can attack in the room
1:28:56 | Ozvoid: I like the sound of it
1:28:56 | FridgeDuck: That sounds pretty sick actually
1:28:56 | Personaless: Agree on tunnel into that building
1:29:03 | Joshua Pinkham: it was beautiful
1:29:05 | Hydro Eclipse: sounds good
1:29:07 | Robert Stegmann: bridge from roof to ledge
1:29:08 | Some Random Dude: who doesn't like a bridge
1:29:09 | Cndvdx Yhjblbilg: A
1:29:12 | dermitio: add tinted glass on the roof as well
1:29:12 | Personaless: make those two walls by that spawn door 1
1:29:18 | Ghostler: @Super Sain my name + two "_" after it is my discord
1:29:19 | FridgeDuck: Make sure that direction is super inaccessible to RED so that snipers don't stand at the end of the new bridge
1:29:26 | Ghostler: where's @Bobo 
1:29:27 | DrTerror: That works well
1:29:29 | DrTerror: yeah
1:29:33 | lostme: they're saying no tunnel
1:29:43 | dermitio: ıg
1:29:47 | lostme: keep the ramp
1:29:49 | dojodog: Red likes to put sentries in there so the tunnel could be really helpful
1:29:49 | Robert Stegmann: yes tunnel
1:29:51 | DrTerror: make a poll!!
1:29:52 | Super Sain: @Ghostler you should post it to rule34
1:29:58 | Bobo: im here
1:30:03 | Михаил Вылегжанин: souds crazy (i dont understand im stpd)
1:30:14 | Robert Stegmann: make the whole map a series of tunnels
1:30:14 | Joshua Pinkham: yes tunnel yes ramp
1:30:19 | Свят iRo: you need to limit visibility until respawn
1:30:21 | dermitio: no
1:30:21 | Robert Stegmann: yes
1:30:23 | Bobo: nah
1:30:23 | Some Random Dude: tunnel with train?
1:30:25 | Cndvdx Yhjblbilg: @shounic why did you private all your previous streams
1:30:26 | BabyCola: yes
1:30:27 | DrTerror: No one uses that honestly, but I dont think it is
1:30:28 | The Great Wizard: kinda
1:30:29 | MN: nah
1:30:29 | Ghostler: it's just a sketch I need to improve on it
1:30:29 | Mr. Tatortot: that's easily fixable
1:30:31 | dojodog: I think that sightline is fine, the pillar blocks it decently
1:30:32 | Bobo: looks fine
1:30:32 | Hydro Eclipse: not really
1:30:32 | Inc0m1ng: not really
1:30:33 | LoolFR: nah, you pass quick enough most of time
1:30:33 | Stolen Comment Corp.: kind of yes
1:30:34 | Doog: yeah
1:30:36 | Some Random Dude: no
1:30:38 | AlrexX extras: yupp
1:30:43 | FridgeDuck: You should be able to go up and sideways to counter it but it's pretty thin otherwise
1:30:43 | DrTerror: It can be easily abused by both sides so its balanced
1:30:47 | Ghostler: @Bobo my discord is just my name and two "_" after it, full lowercase
1:30:48 | TheDesaj2: i think, yes
1:30:59 | BabyCola: I haven't experienced it on red
1:31:00 | The Great Wizard: yes 
1:31:01 | Stolen Comment Corp.: yes
1:31:01 | dermitio: nope
1:31:02 | Super Sain: @Ghostler aight I'll wait for the final
1:31:03 | LoolFR: neither
1:31:05 | Hydro Eclipse: yes
1:31:06 | Bobo: ok
1:31:07 | Inc0m1ng: nope
1:31:07 | maksu: its like dust2 doors, i think its fine
1:31:12 | Robert Stegmann: put a fence over river
1:31:14 | dermitio: it is the spawn one
1:31:14 | lavenderhauk: You need a few sightlines for sniper
1:31:15 | TheDesaj2: yes
1:31:17 | dojodog: that one isnt too bad either
1:31:24 | Hydro Eclipse: sniper in building can see you
1:31:25 | Some Random Dude: spam from the red building is more of a problem
1:31:29 | dojodog: red players are taking a risk walking through it
1:31:29 | Normal Human: just disable sniper on this map easy fix
1:31:33 | DrTerror: That one is hard to counter, but the first one can be pushed by soldiers or demos
1:31:34 | Pompmaker1: put flowing water there
1:31:39 | dermitio: oh right
1:31:42 | LoolFR: i have an idea, put a regular fence at the middle of lake
1:31:44 | maksu: thats bad
1:31:45 | BabyCola: ok that spot is nasty
1:32:03 | dojodog: I think the door should just be moved so snipers in the building cant shoot down it
1:32:06 | lostme: nobuild the pillars real quick
1:32:15 | DrTerror: The only problem in the sniper sightlines are really at spawn, because its still able to be countered
1:32:19 | BabyCola: nobuild the pillars I agree
1:32:24 | dermitio: maybe
1:32:30 | EvGen: Remember the place on the thunder mountain where snipers could snipe you through the half of the map?
1:32:32 | Bobo: add a both way door to block it
1:32:33 | Source engine Gamer 1000: yo shounic whats ur opinion on tf2 children if u have seen one?
1:32:34 | Bobo: fixes
1:32:34 | Robert Stegmann: connect rock pillars with thin bridges
1:32:53 | lostme: I already did
1:32:54 | Some Random Dude: add water flowing from that wall to make shooting from there difficult
1:32:55 | Super Sain: You should make it so that if you select sniper you get perma-banned
1:33:03 | Михаил Вылегжанин: maybe glass wall can fix?
1:33:14 | Some Random Dude: instead of extending it put a waterfall to obscure visibility
1:33:23 | Sexitron9000: maybe add a floating gaben
1:33:29 | The Great Wizard: bridge form blu flank to first philar could be fun 
1:33:40 | Михаил Вылегжанин: wow im not stupid
1:33:43 | maksu: cover the sighline, make sure you can swim under it!
1:33:43 | Stolen Comment Corp.: put rock005
1:33:51 | lostme: sniper sightlines, the solution? wall. and if that ain't work? use more wall
1:34:02 | lostme: also there's MN making notes
1:34:06 | dermitio: turn it upside down
1:34:06 | Михаил Вылегжанин: ahahha
1:34:08 | lostme: MN's good at note making
1:34:08 | LoolFR: make the whole place a cave
1:34:09 | Metbol: remove the fence at the bottom of the waterfall so you can float down the river :)
1:34:12 | Some Random Dude: sideways
1:34:14 | Robert Stegmann: put a wooden cow to block it
1:34:23 | LoolFR: make the whole place a water cave
1:34:26 | dermitio: upside down 
1:34:33 | Some Random Dude: do they make them smaller?
1:34:33 | AlrexX extras: scale it down lel
1:34:37 | Jackson Shipmun: I can feel my frames dropping
1:34:42 | dermitio: yeah
1:34:43 | Ghostler: yes upwards water
1:34:44 | dermitio: so what
1:34:44 | Hydro Eclipse: isn't there a smaller one?
1:34:48 | maksu: i dunno, that looks kinda something
1:34:48 | MN: that looks sick as fuck
1:34:51 | tommya: Make Niagara Falls in TF2 :face-blue-smiling:
1:34:52 | Ghostler: add upwards flowing water
1:34:54 | DrTerror: Torture the art passers lol
1:34:56 | Mold: Make it flow from like a pipe
1:34:57 | lostme: upward flowing water is funny
1:35:15 | Robert Stegmann: Waterrise and not a waterfall
1:35:16 | Some Random Dude: from a pipe might be better
1:35:20 | LoolFR: upwards falling is like steam
1:35:26 | LoolFR: like very watery steam
1:35:28 | Borneovi Flier: remove sniper
1:35:30 | maksu: add a secret behind the waterfall!
1:35:34 | lostme: yeh, that's cool
1:35:37 | Dante Secca: add a huge picture of ur femboy avatar in the skybox 
1:35:44 | Ghostler: ok my sketch of femboy shounic doesn't look that bad
1:35:45 | AlrexX extras: don't worry we're used to having to deal with all the stuff level designers forgot to fix
1:35:47 | MN: at least add a platform so the water isnt floating
1:35:47 | dermitio: make it a gayser or smth
1:35:59 | Ghostler: I think i'll try to put it on ms paint
1:36:06 | Ghostler: to try to make it look better
1:36:09 | Ghostler: GAYser
1:36:10 | DrTerror: It honestly looks horrible because of the building but its pretty cool
1:36:10 | dermitio: nah
1:36:15 | Inc0m1ng: gay lazer
1:36:16 | ButtonMasher: Waterfall but rainbow colored
1:36:17 | tommya: Waterfalls are cool, add more waterfalls, the more waterfalls, the better
1:36:19 | That windows XP fan: Hello
1:36:23 | dojodog: there's a little ledge by the foot-high water that's too tall to step up, a little ramp might be a good idea
1:36:25 | lostme: femboy gayser :3
1:36:26 | LoolFR: its a BAYser 
1:36:26 | MN: at least add a platform so the water isnt floating
1:36:28 | Super Sain: GEYser (make it spew raindow water)
1:36:29 | dojodog: knee-high*
1:36:31 | Ghostler: NAW
1:36:37 | LoolFR: so long gay bayser
1:36:43 | The Great Wizard: adding a fence at the end of river on blu site would me nice 
1:36:46 | MN: at least add a platform so the water isnt floating
1:36:49 | T342: what is happening 
1:36:49 | That windows XP fan: Gayser? Laser? TRIPLE LASER?
1:36:54 | Bobo: femboy gayser the Second opnion
1:36:54 | dojodog: yeah
1:37:02 | DrTerror: femboy shounic and femboy gayser
1:37:05 | dkz: why the waterfall kinda freaky doe
1:37:07 | Михаил Вылегжанин: If they remove the snipers, I won't be able to throw piss anymore((.
1:37:08 | Mold: Make it a water slide
1:37:12 | Ghostler: speaking of femboy
1:37:15 | dermitio: make it flow upwards
1:37:16 | Some Random Dude: geiser which stops occasionally might be cool for the other long sightline
1:37:19 | Ghostler: @shounic i've drawn something terrible
1:37:19 | dermitio: it will be funni
1:37:21 | Metbol: i got stuck near the two pillars by the shallow water
1:37:27 | maksu: some artpasser is going to turn this into a waterpark
1:37:28 | Ghostler: or drew
1:37:28 | dojodog: snipers could still blindly fire through it
1:37:29 | Ghostler: idk
1:37:30 | Drooled HPSK: is it the compile options that makes tf2 auto restart on each compile?
1:37:31 | Bobo: what the fuck is that waterfall bruh :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face:
1:37:31 | That windows XP fan: Wgar
1:37:37 | LoolFR: its great, lets torture the artpassers for what happens
1:37:38 | lostme: DON'T FIX
1:37:38 | Hydro Eclipse: magic water
1:37:39 | Ghostler: that looks so dumb
1:37:40 | lostme: it's perfect
1:37:41 | Михаил Вылегжанин: this should be blue
1:37:42 | DrTerror: yeah
1:37:43 | Super Sain: wager
1:37:45 | patrlim: another map???
1:37:46 | DrTerror: let them deal with it
1:37:46 | Personaless: When you're coming out of blue spawn to the left, I think the two walls should be one. Less bad sightlines into blue spawn
1:37:46 | Ghostler: KEEP IT
1:37:48 | Billy: You can extend the rocks a little and make a cavern underneath, it could work
1:37:49 | Source engine Gamer 1000: "SCoUt I hAVe a CONtrACt FOr YOu" -Nerd. Pauling
1:37:50 | Ghostler: IT LOOKS TOO DUMB
1:37:50 | MN: the artpassers can fix it
1:37:50 | DrTerror: we can be blamed
1:37:53 | That windows XP fan: He's still laughing at it
1:37:54 | Egg Binary: art passes beware
1:37:54 | Ghostler: IT LOOKS VERY VERY DUMB KEEP IT
1:37:58 | Rayman33: put like water coming from the ground like a fountain
1:37:59 | Rayman33: put like water coming from the ground like a fountain
1:38:03 | Some Random Dude: it's perfect
1:38:09 | Myst: could make it come out of some kind of aqueduct to at least make it make sense
1:38:11 | Михаил Вылегжанин: CUM waterfall
1:38:13 | Stolen Comment Corp.: not our problem
1:38:14 | Ghostler: MAKE A GLASS WINDOW BELLOW SO IT LOOKS LIKE A COOL TUNNEL
1:38:14 | Bobo: CAN YOU ATLEAST PUT THE WATERFALL ONTOP OF THE ROCKS
1:38:14 | Metbol: try to walk between the two pillars at the bottom of the waterfall
1:38:15 | Inc0m1ng: y'all truly sounding like engineers now
1:38:16 | dermitio: yeah its good
1:38:16 | That windows XP fan: Make the water come out of a pipe
1:38:20 | The Great Wizard: yup
1:38:20 | DrTerror: They look alright now
1:38:25 | maksu: yeah, its fine
1:38:26 | DrTerror: the rest can be countered
1:38:27 | Some Random Dude: yea
1:38:30 | patrlim: holy shit
1:38:32 | Ghostler: LOL
1:38:36 | That windows XP fan: :(
1:38:40 | Bobo: that Works
1:38:45 | dojodog: is there gonna be a block bullets there
1:38:50 | Михаил Вылегжанин: CUM waterfall
1:38:51 | Source engine Gamer 1000: meth is my favori- FBI OPEN TF UP!
1:38:51 | patrlim: add a push brush in the water
1:38:58 | lostme: tf2 stealth gamemode :o
1:38:59 | DrTerror: Just let them walk on it and they fall down onto the building
1:39:00 | FreeAndLit: the artpasser will fix my life
1:39:02 | DrTerror: instantly 10/10 map
1:39:06 | MN: its fine we can see their feets
1:39:07 | Some Random Dude: no just add push
1:39:08 | patrlim: make it hella fast
1:39:11 | Rayman33: put a fountain
1:39:15 | Bobo: add a push_ent in there
1:39:16 | patrlim: make a push thats super fast
1:39:19 | Hydro Eclipse: add a clip brush so plays stand ontop the water, or a push force
1:39:22 | DrTerror: Add push would make the entire map peak 
1:39:31 | Personaless: there's a bad sightline on the leftside of blue spawn, can go all the way back to ledge, can add in an overhang to make it batter
1:39:31 | DrTerror: it would become dustbowl but better
1:39:35 | Some Random Dude: make it push buildings as well lol
1:39:37 | dojodog: phlog pyros are gonna have a field day with that
1:39:38 | Mold: the wall is drooling
1:39:46 | DrTerror: Waterfall trickshots
1:39:46 | Super Sain: This chat is a bunch of guys in a garage building the most fucked up shit know to man 50% of the time and the other 50% chat is down bad for femshoe
1:39:48 | patrlim: i contributed!
1:39:48 | That windows XP fan: Does this map have a massive skybox or is it trolldir heaven 
1:39:51 | MN: make it possible
1:39:52 | Robert Stegmann: could also be a kill zone
1:40:01 | Some Random Dude: the rtd mod pushes buildings
1:40:01 | patrlim: make it destroy projectiles but not bullets
1:40:08 | dermitio: add the whole femshoe PNG in the red box
1:40:10 | Metbol: cover in front of red spawn
1:40:14 | Jackson Shipmun: there's a narrow corridor near the point that you can't walk through
1:40:17 | That windows XP fan: Too many soilder shoot points
1:40:22 | Bobo: RED spawn is too close to the point
1:40:27 | That windows XP fan: Func_2fort_spawn
1:40:30 | Robert Stegmann: complete the wall in between point and spawn
1:40:30 | AlrexX extras: just needs to turn some routes into caves to help optimization
1:40:38 | Personaless: Red soldiers and demos can bomb that first opening to ledge and restock way too quickly
1:40:48 | That windows XP fan: Copy it from decompiling bad water 
1:40:52 | dojodog: it'd be nice if spawnpoints could just work within the volume of a brush
1:40:54 | That windows XP fan: Yes
1:40:54 | DrTerror: There is too many flanks for blu to abuse and red can basically jump up to the multiple flanks above them and not have much problems doing so, demos can just sticky or pipe spam as well
1:40:58 | That windows XP fan: Enable it
1:40:59 | patrlim: shounic is the vtuber avatar supposed to be ur PFP cat?
1:41:04 | Some Random Dude: make it require an among us engine room task to open the red spawn door
1:41:12 | dojodog: yay no more stuck spot
1:41:14 | DrTerror: Even though it sounds fine its basically making it confusing for blu to strategise 
1:41:30 | Deranged: blud thinks he is valve :skull::skull::skull:
1:41:30 | Sexitron9000: add a secret shounic easter egg
1:41:37 | dermitio: add the PNG to the box
1:41:42 | Scrumby & Plumbo: How’s my favorites femboy doing
1:41:43 | lostme: restore the ramp
1:41:44 | That windows XP fan: Yes
1:41:52 | Some Random Dude: train inbetween point and red spawn?
1:41:58 | Bobo: add a flank to the point
1:42:00 | maksu: could you still try to make the bridge steeper :pleading_face:
1:42:01 | patrlim: 4 square not 3 lane]
1:42:07 | OctoBurr: femboy!!
1:42:08 | patrlim: 4 square not 3 lane
1:42:14 | Bobo: blu can barely even get near the point
1:42:18 | That windows XP fan: Add a hilariously big ceiling to fix 99% of problems 
1:42:18 | ChaoticRobot: can we fix the femboy thing
1:42:22 | Михаил Вылегжанин: put a medic kit in this corner)
1:42:22 | ChaoticRobot: like
1:42:24 | ChaoticRobot: refund
1:42:24 | Mold: Why is the stream spliced
1:42:24 | Robert Stegmann: the lanes are all going all in the same direction. One should be a different angle
1:42:25 | The Great Wizard: 2 flanks may be too little 
1:42:35 | AlrexX extras: maybe could use more negative space i guess
1:42:36 | patrlim: @Mold it does look spliced
1:42:43 | Super Sain: add femboy png to distract red
1:42:49 | Some Random Dude: put random pushers near the ceiling to make soldiers and demos confused
1:42:50 | That windows XP fan: Add sewers
1:42:52 | DrTerror: I get what you mean by it being fine, I guess blu just needs to adapt to firsdt
1:43:07 | Source engine Gamer 1000: will you tell us in stream when ur server opens for everyone again and will it be always the same server code?
1:43:16 | DrTerror: Youtube character limit makes it pretty hard for me to be clear
1:43:16 | Mr.Kleiner: wtf is this
1:43:19 | That windows XP fan: add 2Fort sewers from blu spawn straight to under the point
1:43:20 | Some Random Dude: underground flank?
1:43:21 | Metbol: put a 1 way blu ramp in the elbow cave near point
1:43:26 | DrTerror: but I can try msg about it if thats possible
1:43:28 | Some Random Dude: tunnels could be cool
1:43:32 | Jerome Henry: Ur mom gay
1:43:34 | Михаил Вылегжанин: oou^(
1:43:34 | Super Sain: add 2fort sewers
1:43:38 | Stolen Comment Corp.: add a tunnel near the waterfall where blu can attack the control point
1:43:44 | werecat: it'd be nice if blu had a ramp to get to their right high ground without walking through spawn
1:43:46 | Source engine Gamer 1000: oh
1:43:51 | nub nub: what if you put a flank route in the sky
1:43:55 | NiGHTcapD: add poles and blocks and props for cover from sniper. Splatoon did that
1:44:01 | GunmanCarl: above ground flank 
1:44:02 | That windows XP fan: Under the waterfall
1:44:03 | Robert Stegmann: add a path from the blue spawn battlement that that turns 90 degrees to overlook the water bridge/red tunnel area
1:44:06 | Joshua Pinkham: ramp to roof of the middle red building for blu
1:44:06 | GunmanCarl: frfr
1:44:08 | patrlim: make the tunnel BEHIND the waterfall
1:44:10 | Super Sain: add every single flank from every single map
1:44:15 | Source engine Gamer 1000: well you could allow others to joinwhen testing some new changes right?
1:44:17 | Some Random Dude: I think the ratio of players to flanks needs to be maintained or at least closer from 12v12
1:44:18 | Александр Виноградов: move point in red cabin right after ramp
1:44:21 | maksu: YEAAAH WATER TUNNELS WOO
1:44:33 | Inc0m1ng: pyro shark is gonna love this change
1:44:36 | dermitio: would be funi
1:44:40 | That windows XP fan: Water tunnel gaming 
1:44:42 | Some Random Dude: 12v12 maps have like 2 or 3 flanks which isn't enough for 50v50
1:44:46 | AnonWithAHatOn: anything that helps pyro shark is good
1:44:47 | patrlim: :musical_notes: SECRET TUNNEL :musical_notes:
1:44:55 | AnonWithAHatOn: remake the level as a water park
1:44:56 | Александр Виноградов: just move point closer
1:44:58 | Source engine Gamer 1000: hey shounic whats ur favorite tf2 class
1:45:00 | That windows XP fan: Under the point

1:45:16 | patrlim: spawn
1:45:18 | DeltaSatelite-96: Left. Right seems to be close to objective.

1:46:03 | patrlim: my beloved
1:46:07 | Some Random Dude: the underwater sightline is too long tho
1:46:07 | dojodog: every time i tab out of youtube and back in chat disappears for like a minute
1:46:07 | endarkenedgd: HAMMER STREAM POG
1:46:10 | Foxxxy: Aww no Shounic is also cute :3
1:46:18 | Ozvoid: The pyrosharks are endangered, they need to be pandered to.
1:46:22 | patrlim: add a crate underwater to break line of sight]
1:46:29 | Dr Hund: Haven't been to a livestream ever since the first "map". How are things?
1:46:30 | Ozvoid: It's an act of preservation
1:46:38 | Ghostler: how do I make a layer in paint?
1:46:45 | That windows XP fan: Add a small underwater cave that you can place sentries in

1:48:02 | tommya: Add an onsen with pngs of anime women

1:48:30 | patrlim: WHAT IS THAT 2D VIEW
1:48:32 | patrlim: BRUH
1:48:32 | lostme: methinks toy can just raise the rocks at least
1:48:34 | Ozvoid: @Some Random Dude What fucking climate is this place.
1:48:49 | patrlim: CRASH IS CRYING RN
1:48:51 | Super Sain: @Ghostler you can make a layer by pressing the rightmost button on the toolbar, might not be there if you have an older version of paint
1:48:54 | Some Random Dude: adding ice to the top of the water would make it a better flank as it cant be spammed from above
1:49:14 | patrlim: IF CRASH WAS DEAD, HED BE ROLLING IN HIS GRAVE
1:49:21 | Z: why aren't you a femboy?
1:49:35 | Super Sain: @Z
1:49:36 | Super Sain: fr
1:49:39 | Bigga: are you from ohio or something>
1:49:40 | patrlim: why are you @Z
1:49:44 | dermitio: add the png in the tunnel
1:49:46 | lostme: z-fighting, yum
1:49:47 | Robert Stegmann: add a path from the blue spawn battlement that that turns 90 degrees to overlook the water bridge/red tunnel area. It would be near the red overlook path
1:49:48 | Ozvoid: There could be a boat and a pier maybe to cover the top of the water.
1:49:58 | Bigga: Woah bro is hacing into the goverment
1:50:11 | Z: @patrlim because its fun
1:50:14 | NiGHTcapD: let them first
1:50:17 | NiGHTcapD: fight*
1:50:17 | maksu: ENTER THE FUN TUNNEL
1:50:22 | patrlim: @shounic thats a problem for VIS, that isnt an artpass thing
1:50:22 | nicopatty: hi
1:50:29 | Some Random Dude: make the tunnel angled upwards
1:50:33 | patrlim: you need to fix that zfighting
1:50:34 | Reich Rape: shounic see scouts pistol, it shoots 9x19 milimeter
1:50:35 | NiGHTcapD: I want to see some something where z-fighting is part of the aesthetic
1:50:46 | aslanalpin: can we donate to remove the text over the avatar?
1:50:47 | Reich Rape: ingame if you get shot by scouts pistol in the head you live
1:50:48 | Ozvoid: That's a nice flank
1:50:56 | Robert Stegmann: Extra room for health pack and amo
1:50:57 | dojodog: this is a very TFC-esque concept
1:51:00 | Ozvoid: @aslanalpin genius
1:51:00 | DrTerror: Its a good alternative for how long the right side is from the point
1:51:03 | DrTerror: and its pretty funny
1:51:05 | DrTerror: it works
1:51:06 | Mr.Kleiner: nice camp point
1:51:11 | Inc0m1ng: tunnel will probably need some lighting to make it easier to navigate and to highlight its existence to new players
1:51:12 | Lochness Lachster: I’ve always wanted to hear Shounic say “As you can see. The scout head has become to large for the game to handle and it crashes”
1:51:14 | patrlim: 2k in one dono
1:51:16 | maksu: woo water tunnel!
1:51:17 | Ozvoid: Yeah
1:51:18 | DrTerror: Its like a good shortcut 
1:51:19 | dermitio: yea
1:51:20 | Some Random Dude: can the water tunnel have an air pocket in it
1:51:21 | Z: how much to make you become a femboy?
1:51:24 | patrlim: the water is funny
1:51:24 | Personaless: water tunnel could be fun
1:51:25 | D1V1S: It's hard to see but I guess art-passers will fix that
1:51:26 | Some Random Dude: yes water
1:51:29 | tommya: Keep it in
1:51:30 | Metbol: water gameplay is based
1:51:32 | Jackson Shipmun: it should be at least 2.5 people wide
1:51:32 | Billy: swimming sucks mid battle it will get boring quickly
1:51:34 | Александр Виноградов: can u just move point closer?
1:51:36 | DrTerror: The artpassers are gonna hate you 
1:51:43 | Some Random Dude: tf2 needs more maps which make use of water
1:51:45 | Ozvoid: What if there was a small room under water that has air that engies could place a tele.
1:51:51 | Metbol: remove the cover in front of red spawn
1:51:51 | TimBTW: why is he a femboy again
1:51:52 | DeltaSatelite-96: is this map take place on dam? 
1:51:55 | Dr Hund: I always just place Heavies for reference
1:52:00 | Some Random Dude: ice on top of water to make spam into it from above difficult
1:52:00 | Lochness Lachster: Overhead coverage
1:52:02 | Reich Rape: 𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫
1:52:03 | johny guacamole: how much do i need to donate to turn your avatar into an anthropomorphic furry 
1:52:04 | Personaless: Please do something with the walls at the left of blue spawn, they're really bad cover
1:52:06 | MN: discord :p
1:52:07 | Reich Rape: 𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫𒐫
1:52:11 | Joshua Pinkham: @TimBTW he always was a femboy
1:52:19 | Jackson Shipmun: my reasoning is that I hate accidentally running into someone while I'm an invisible spy
1:52:20 | lostme: you should've shifted the rocks up in the first place :P
1:52:26 | dojodog: I'm still gonna talk about the knee high water because there's a ramp to help players walk out of it on the second point but not the first
1:52:27 | Ozvoid: What if there was a dry room put in the tunnel for teles to be built.
1:52:33 | Some Random Dude: maybe ice walls in the water to split up the large area of water
1:52:34 | BootlegRoman: Is there shark?
1:52:38 | Ghostler: ok I need to find a free drawing app to draw femboy shounic
1:52:39 | Robert Stegmann: flank for blu from battlement around waterfall to an overlook
1:52:41 | TimBTW: on god
1:53:08 | Joshua Pinkham: @Ghostler based
1:53:10 | Source engine Gamer 1000: will u public server again after these changes
1:53:17 | Dr Hund: @Ghostler Computer or Phone?
1:53:18 | Lochness Lachster: This map looks so retro
1:53:20 | lostme: that's an easter egg for the artpassers
1:53:23 | Ghostler: computer
1:53:28 | MN: @shounic discord checklist
1:53:29 | Ghostler: on phone it's too diff
1:53:30 | Some Random Dude: underwater ice walls in water
1:53:33 | Ghostler: I prefer a mouse
1:53:37 | Source engine Gamer 1000: pls just start server
1:53:37 | Dr Hund: GIMP is the way
1:53:44 | Some Random Dude: ice on top of water so it can only be entered from certain points
1:53:44 | maksu: can you still try to make the bridge steeper to fix blu sightline :pleading_face:
1:53:46 | Personaless: make those two walls on the left one big wall okease
1:53:48 | Robert Stegmann: flank on right side of waterfall for blue
1:53:50 | BootlegRoman: Yeah, Ice, add ice
1:53:52 | Ghostler: the sketch is done I just need an app that has layers
1:54:00 | Lochness Lachster: Props can help, like barrels and boxes for cover
1:54:03 | Dr Hund: @Ghostler GIMP
1:54:06 | Personaless: outside blue spawn
1:54:06 | Joshua Pinkham: make the back left red building full ammo and health pack
1:54:10 | Personaless: the leftmost door
1:54:11 | Lochness Lachster: But that comes later
1:54:13 | Ozvoid: I so want to see a dry room in the tunnel.
1:54:16 | Metbol: remove the cover in front of red spawn
1:54:18 | Dr Hund: basically free photoshop of with slightly less things
1:54:18 | Zepherz's: Add Saxton hale spawn in the middle top of map
1:54:21 | Personaless: coming out of bluespawn
1:54:32 | Personaless: the left is useless to blast damage
1:54:36 | Some Random Dude: underwater walls and boulders for cover
1:54:48 | Personaless: Thanks
1:54:58 | lostme: make it glass c:
1:55:01 | dojodog: i literlly just found out that swimup and swimdown let you move up and down with noclip holy shit this is groundbreaking for my feeble mind
1:55:01 | Lochness Lachster: Failed to load :( could not load Gabs_Newell-Valve-MDL
1:55:16 | Personaless: yep, thank you
1:55:16 | Ozvoid: @Some Random Dude could place a freight container in the water with both sides open.
1:55:25 | Sebstion: place fences therer
1:55:35 | DrTerror: I feel like there should be less entrances (decreased to 2) in the cave so blu focuses on attacking on the point and in red spawn, but it could be annoying for red, possibly shifting entrances away?
1:55:36 | Col. Klink 1965: Femboy shounic real
1:55:39 | Robert Stegmann: flank to go around the waterfall for blue to enter the open area from a 90 degree angle
1:55:47 | Personaless: Glass is fine, I thought it just needed more cover, since demos could spam into spawn through that too
1:55:51 | Zepherz's: add more Saxtonhale
1:55:51 | Lochness Lachster: Does the map have an artistic theme yet?
1:55:52 | DrTerror: It could help with not spamming as much there
1:56:15 | DrTerror: Because currently blu is focusing too much on all 3 and it makes their push weaker
1:56:22 | Lochness Lachster: Make it a bent fence
1:56:29 | Ozvoid: @Personaless I feel glass would be temporary, it definitely wouldn't look good in the art pass.
1:56:42 | DrTerror: That works great
1:56:48 | Super Sain: @Ghostler ibis paint has a desktop client I think
1:56:52 | Ozvoid: That looks cool
1:56:57 | Robert Stegmann: why use longer fence when you can shorten gap
1:57:06 | lostme: wait, what's this? shounic's using the grid? impossible
1:57:09 | Ozvoid: Its kinda wacky, but its cool.
1:57:11 | maksu: i just felt the scream of a thousand artpassers screaming
1:57:16 | Lochness Lachster: Anyone who’s worked with fences before will know that this fence wouldn’t stand
1:57:17 | Joshua Pinkham: the artpassers will fix it
1:57:25 | Jackson Shipmun: will a demoman/soldier be able to stand on top?
1:57:39 | Dr Hund: why do they need to be so high again?
1:57:52 | Lochness Lachster: Make an inverted trapezium clip
1:57:54 | lostme: is this cp_ongrid at last?
1:57:56 | Some Random Dude: maybe don't clip it and make it do bleed damage
1:57:56 | dojodog: I hope an artpasser turns the pyramid into the Bass Pro Shops Pyramid 
1:58:13 | Ozvoid: LOL
1:58:18 | Get on League guys: Demo clearly needs to be better 
1:58:21 | Ozvoid: That would be amazing
1:58:23 | A Blue Nebula: sniper is the worst class to play against and the best class to play as
1:58:29 | A Blue Nebula: change my mind
1:58:30 | Source engine Gamer 1000: i think were alr
1:58:31 | Scrumby & Plumbo: How do I play
1:58:34 | Dr Hund: yeah, unless they can't do that because they'll get blasted on the sides while they spam
1:58:37 | DrTerror: I have a suggestion above about cave
1:58:39 | Some Random Dude: underwater walls and boulders
1:58:41 | Zepherz's: saxton....hale....
1:58:50 | Personaless: I think that alternate route to ramp was the only big thing for me, but the wall makes it easier to push there
1:58:54 | Ozvoid: Make the water a sort of freshwater lake and stuff as a primo fishing spot, and make the pyramid bass pro shop.
1:58:55 | Source engine Gamer 1000: yes
1:58:55 | Some Random Dude: ice on top of water so you can only enter and exit as some points
1:58:56 | Penny Jim: Enhancer for youtube with the expanded mode _does not_ like Youtube's live chat for some reason
1:58:58 | Source engine Gamer 1000: its alr
1:59:03 | maksu: yes
1:59:05 | Александр Виноградов: yeah
1:59:08 | Lochness Lachster: Place railing on the bridges
1:59:09 | H34R73Y3D: yes?
1:59:12 | Hydro Eclipse: sounds good
1:59:13 | MN: stream mod when...
1:59:16 | Ozvoid: It works for now
1:59:17 | Jackson Shipmun: yeah, with shorter blu respawns we'll be able to make more accurate adjustments later
1:59:22 | Scrumby & Plumbo: Is this going to be played on trenches or the test server
1:59:29 | Sopra: Just arrived, what's the lore on the "not a femboy"
1:59:31 | Lochness Lachster: Railings like suijin
1:59:32 | Sebstion: i think there is too many rock texture
1:59:47 | Александр Виноградов: new flank, new los block , i guess its good
1:59:49 | Some Random Dude: needs underwater obstacles
2:00:03 | Jackson Shipmun: way too easy for blu
2:00:09 | Александр Виноградов: point 2 is good
2:00:11 | Source engine Gamer 1000: we should test rn, i want to join
2:00:12 | maksu: the point gets captured too fast
2:00:13 | lostme: point 2 is perfect (no bias)
2:00:15 | AlrexX extras: much better than i thought it would be
2:00:16 | dojodog: I think the stairs down are kind of awkward
2:00:16 | Александр Виноградов: last point suck
2:00:23 | Aw Man: the spawn thing cucked it so we got no point 2 fights
2:00:23 | Dr Hund: so what's the map's name this time? Deez3?
2:00:24 | Some Random Dude: increase cap time
2:00:24 | Aw Man: basically
2:00:27 | Personaless: Fix the spawn before modifying it, honestly
2:00:32 | Ghostler: ok I got a free drawing app i'm gonna draw femboy shouni
2:00:36 | Rayman33: yeah it's good but add something like a jump pad maybe
2:00:56 | Hydro Eclipse: demos and soldiers can rocket jump from the top onto the point
2:00:58 | maksu: fix that spawn fight issue, then i can give feedback
2:00:59 | dojodog: scout casually landing on barbed wire
2:01:00 | Scrumby & Plumbo: Are we play testing this again today @shounic
2:01:00 | Some Random Dude: maybe move spawn forward as well
2:01:01 | lostme: shounic, it takes red even longer +respawn
2:01:07 | Super Sain: make the barbed wire do bleed if you touch it
2:01:10 | Super Sain: for the funni
2:01:11 | Some Random Dude: the distance from point 1 to 2 should be greater
2:01:11 | Metbol: remove the fence under the bridge in front of the waterfall, so i can float down :)
2:01:12 | Dr Hund: I often include the Atomizer scouts in my plans for extra routes and parkour
2:01:22 | Jackson Shipmun: blu base jumper sticky launcher demos dominated point 2
2:01:33 | Some Random Dude: distance from spawn is fine its just point 1 to 2
2:01:34 | dojodog: were blue respawn times reduced or was it determined not a problem
2:01:36 | Александр Виноградов: 4 point bad
2:01:39 | Source engine Gamer 1000: i mean before stream does end u should do one last test
2:01:39 | Joshua Pinkham: point 2 is hard to defend
2:01:41 | Александр Виноградов: 2-3 ok
2:01:43 | Jackson Shipmun: yeah
2:01:48 | maksu: yeah, i agree
2:01:52 | Some Random Dude: red needs more time to recover and setup from losing point 1
2:01:52 | Aw Man: ye we didnt test much there anyway
2:01:56 | Source engine Gamer 1000: yes
2:01:56 | DrTerror: I think point 2 should have a clip on the top so you can jump onto second
2:02:00 | Hydro Eclipse: leave it for now
2:02:01 | Jackson Shipmun: an easy blu point isn't as "bad" as an easy red point
2:02:05 | Personaless: Definitely leave it until point A is fixed
2:02:10 | DrTerror: because blue can take a while to get to 2
2:02:11 | maksu: sure, lets wait until next test :)
2:02:31 | Some Random Dude: ye
2:02:36 | DrTerror: Thats perfect
2:02:40 | Some Random Dude: that would help
2:02:42 | DrTerror: it prevents half the team suffering
2:02:44 | lostme: it should be like that on all maps, hell yeah
2:02:50 | Александр Виноградов: 3 ok
2:02:52 | Personaless: I didn't know this point existed during play
2:03:00 | DrTerror: Point 3 was taken pretty quick
2:03:01 | Александр Виноградов: point 4 bad
2:03:03 | Some Random Dude: too big sightlines?
2:03:06 | DrTerror: there isnt a lot to say
2:03:07 | Aw Man: its kinda awkward to defend tho
2:03:09 | Metbol: that whole wide flank is horrible
2:03:09 | Source engine Gamer 1000: red doesnt need a change rn
2:03:20 | Some Random Dude: too easy for demo with sticky jumper
2:03:25 | Mav: wanna hop on mario kart wii
2:03:30 | DrTerror: For spies and snipers its a pretty good field day, but yeah its too wide for red to defend, a lot of space to cover
2:03:35 | Some Random Dude: needs to be more closed
2:03:42 | TheDesaj2: make the trenches wider.
2:03:51 | Personaless: It's such a wide open map that sticky jumper reigns supreme
2:03:55 | werecat: parachuting demos a mile up in the sky are the bane of my existance
2:03:58 | maksu: make the secret tunnel under the point more obvious
2:03:58 | dojodog: I feel like there's too much water
2:03:58 | Rayman33: pint 3 is very open make it like harvest point
2:04:04 | dermitio: just leave it be
2:04:08 | aslanalpin: make the water more opaque so we can avoid the snipers by jumping into water.
2:04:11 | DrTerror: Yeah its pretty much fine other than that
2:04:15 | Some Random Dude: layout is good it's more the proportions
2:04:15 | DrTerror: it works well
2:04:16 | Metbol: water with push triggers and jumps and shit
2:04:30 | tommya: Double swimming speed
2:04:32 | dermitio: sights
2:04:35 | Source engine Gamer 1000: should we start soon?
2:04:37 | DrTerror: Unless we get more info on point 3 I dont see the point on doing much with it
2:04:39 | Personaless: I hate the maze like walls
2:04:40 | Александр Виноградов: snipers
2:04:41 | dermitio: snipers are op here
2:04:43 | Some Random Dude: serious sightline problem
2:04:43 | Inc0m1ng: I got stuck a bunch on point 4 
2:04:46 | Aw Man: I think red spawn to the inside sightline is just scuffed
2:04:47 | Inc0m1ng: specifcally with stairs
2:04:49 | Aw Man: yeah
2:04:50 | Metbol: lot of random useless cover
2:04:55 | SonR3bel: i love men
2:04:58 | Some Random Dude: blus teleporters get spammed
2:04:58 | lostme: fix the step c:
2:05:00 | dermitio: yes
2:05:02 | Samson Dreemurr: Swiftwater moment
2:05:04 | dojodog: the sightline from spawn is insane
2:05:05 | Jackson Shipmun: yeah the snipe into spawn was :\
2:05:09 | Jole: you get stuck on the stairs left of last blu spawn
2:05:10 | dojodog: sniper heaven on the last point
2:05:14 | Jole: the first step
2:05:17 | Some Random Dude: needs some sort of overhand above blu spawn
2:05:24 | maksu: aw man :(
2:05:29 | Samson Dreemurr: Soldiers would love this tight cover. 
2:05:34 | Александр Виноградов: this ponts suck
2:05:40 | Sebstion: i'll make bigger bridge on the left
2:05:41 | dojodog: the overmind
2:05:41 | Inc0m1ng: you can get stuck on the stairs on the left of blu spawn
2:05:43 | Dr Hund: maybe they mean a balcony/roof access
2:05:46 | Immigrating Box: Arch
2:05:46 | Source engine Gamer 1000: max su yo momma got killed by f2p spy and so didn ur dad >:((((((
2:05:46 | werecat: I mean blu being able to snipe the point from spawn isn't good either
2:05:47 | Billy: they need the upperhand
2:05:51 | Some Random Dude: blu teleporters kept getting spammed by sticky jumper demos, direct hit and snipers
2:05:52 | Aw Man: also I think the stairs on the left is bugged
2:05:55 | Aw Man: yea this
2:06:01 | Ghostler: "it's over, hand" like a hero that the villain is named "hand"
2:06:08 | Krackin Gibbs: I don't think the ability for players to counter snipe should be used as an excuse to keep a sightline
2:06:09 | Personaless: There's like 10 videos on TF2 stairs released recently, come on
2:06:23 | lostme: maksu, your performance was sub-optimal >:)
2:06:25 | Some Random Dude: LED has good map design tips
2:06:35 | Mr. Tatortot: angled brush smh
2:06:38 | DrTerror: I feel like point 4's problem was that red were able to defend really well because of the height inside the pyramid covering buildings so spamming was kind of nerfed
2:07:00 | DrTerror: An organized uber push can kind of break it down though
2:07:02 | Personaless: I like LED's videos but he's got The Burger Foot Lettuce voice and it's a tad annoying
2:07:05 | Some Random Dude: I think spamming is good being nerfed
2:07:13 | Metbol: true make the pyramid larger
2:07:19 | Krackin Gibbs: @DrTerror there are also 2 doors right by the point that engis can put a large nest behind with no flank going into the nest room
2:07:30 | Some Random Dude: you should actually have to aim and use strategy to succeed
2:07:35 | tommya: Invert the pyramid
2:07:53 | Jole: lol people are still voting
2:07:55 | DrTerror: Fair enough, I think the problems were that engis could just make buildings inside spawn, which would be very unlikely when its played properly
2:08:00 | Some Random Dude: maybe a hole in the roof of the pyramid?
2:08:04 | DrTerror: I think thats how red won a lot of the time
2:08:14 | DrTerror: The pyramid should have more entrances for red though
2:08:23 | Super Sain: noooooo this is rigged the poll should have been up longer
2:08:26 | DrTerror: maybe an opening into the room inside the pyramid
2:08:30 | Odd Orycto: can you add a picture of Canada somewhere pretty please? BTW am from Somalia 🇸🇴 🇸🇴 🇸🇴
2:08:31 | Immigrating Box: make the pyramid float like its made by illuminats
2:08:34 | Jackson Shipmun: I actually quite liked the last point. Especially because blu can flank into red spawn
2:08:35 | Some Random Dude: too easy for blu to get around the pyramid
2:08:50 | Inc0m1ng: hi mom
2:09:01 | dermitio: it is just rocket/pill spam inside
2:09:04 | lostme: there was a demo on the pyramid shooting into red
2:09:05 | dermitio: maybe that
2:09:10 | Some Random Dude: blu needs a canopy and a wall around their spawn
2:09:15 | Metbol: red needs lanes to defend other angles
2:09:18 | Some Random Dude: or enable building in blu spawn
2:09:21 | Source engine Gamer 1000: yo momma gets killed by a f2p spy Incoming guy
2:09:30 | Jackson Shipmun: yeah that was cool, snipers counter flying demos
2:09:32 | Personaless: is there a cow on the map yet?
2:09:54 | Metbol: clip off the pyramid so you cant surf on it
2:10:11 | Source engine Gamer 1000: gosh im getting bored
2:10:12 | Immigrating Box: addd cow
2:10:14 | maksu: i like pyramid surfing
2:10:38 | Immigrating Box: add a cow
2:10:43 | (New member) Shindlers Pist: fixed yay
2:10:59 | dermitio: yes
2:11:05 | Egg Binary: sex corner
2:11:07 | Some Random Dude: a canopy above blu spawn would be good to keep out spam from above
2:11:11 | dermitio: there should be
2:11:13 | Metbol: red doesnt have great angles to defend the sides from
2:11:22 | tommya: Add a sarcophagus containing gray mann
2:11:23 | Inc0m1ng: the only problem I saw was sentries everywhere by blue near the doors so red was forced inside the point 
2:11:25 | Immigrating Box: add a cow
2:11:36 | Some Random Dude: sticky jumper and direct hit kept spamming
2:11:36 | Personaless: I think demos with the base jumper are going above
2:11:54 | Some Random Dude: had to rebuilt teleporters like 10 times
2:11:58 | Metbol: scale up the mini spire to be a full on spire
2:12:06 | 0scr_: trench warfare
2:12:14 | Yxoko: its true we paid a lot :)
2:12:20 | Jackson Shipmun: that's a feature not a bug
2:12:27 | nbvdkamp: You don't even need a base jumper, you can just surf on the ramp and stay there
2:12:31 | dermitio: in the pyramid room
2:12:38 | Nonmoth: what is this map???
2:12:44 | Ghostler: alright I finnally set up a drawing app, now I will suffer thru drawing shounic femboy
2:12:46 | Sebstion: bigger left bridge? it's claustrophobic
2:12:53 | dojodog: is the weird disc standing up at 2nd point a penny that doubles in size every day
2:12:58 | Sebstion: i mean that one with the walls
2:13:00 | H34R73Y3D: demo + base jumper = free hitman heat maker charge
2:13:07 | Joshua Pinkham: the right flank is too out the way so the left flank and main route are preferred
2:13:17 | Inc0m1ng: lock n load?
2:13:28 | Some Random Dude: sticky and base jumper
2:13:30 | AlrexX extras: no but you can spam into red from there
2:13:36 | Dr Hund: People should play Anti-Air heavy more often
2:13:41 | Super Sain: @Some Random Dude sniper
2:13:56 | lostme: glass, yummy
2:14:00 | Some Random Dude: Well the snipers on blu were no good then
2:14:00 | Joshua Pinkham: maybe add cover for the right flank so that there is a reason to go there
2:14:07 | Tonikks: hey dude what you from?
2:14:16 | Personaless: Just turn the pyramid into the one from the Louvre
2:14:22 | Metbol: beautiful
2:14:26 | Александр Виноградов: just made red spawn closed
2:14:27 | Some Random Dude: rotate the pyramid so it's a little off angle
2:14:35 | dojodog: haven't been paying full attention to the stream; was the spawn door that clips fixed?
2:14:37 | Billy: what will the artpassers do with the giant glass wall haha
2:14:51 | (New member) Shindlers Pist: you said that about dbz
2:14:51 | Source engine Gamer 1000: can we just continue
2:14:58 | pilly nutty: did you fix the water being weird with projectiles yet
2:15:03 | dermitio: or add a giant sphinx
2:15:05 | Some Random Dude: surround the pyramid in a giant tent
2:15:06 | Source engine Gamer 1000: i wanna join
2:15:07 | Personaless: There's an odd number of crates by point b, and odd numbers are conspicuous. Remake the whole map
2:15:15 | Stolen Comment Corp.: never back down, never give up
2:15:17 | lostme: there are roots in the middle of the tree :o
2:15:21 | Dr Hund: maybe it's the water material that has an issue?
2:15:29 | Александр Виноградов: can we make a last red spawn closed?
2:15:31 | Source engine Gamer 1000: i dont wanna wait for a hour for me to play sob
2:15:35 | RT-YTA: I'm here for femboy not tf2
2:15:35 | Александр Виноградов: like in cave
2:15:48 | Some Random Dude: put a massive canopy over the entire pyramid zone so it's like in isolation or something
2:15:52 | Aw Man: hes not going to test again today just go play in trench lol
2:15:53 | Some Random Dude: like a giant greenhouse
2:16:00 | Inc0m1ng: Rome didn't build the giant glass wall in a day
2:16:00 | tommya: Make top of pyramid flat
2:16:01 | Александр Виноградов: make red spawn in cave
2:16:04 | Source engine Gamer 1000: yo shounic whats ur opinion ot children in tf2?
2:16:06 | dojodog: Were the doors at D fixed?
2:16:21 | Metbol: add a mini surf map in the skybox
2:16:25 | werecat: I can't believe TF2 is cancelled
2:16:32 | Source engine Gamer 1000: can we play?
2:16:39 | Some Random Dude: add a moat
2:16:40 | Source engine Gamer 1000: i wanna play tf2
2:16:44 | Stolen Comment Corp.: change the tree color to yellow
2:16:46 | DrTerror: Red was able to flank pretty easily when 4th point came around, I think that was made easy with the wide arch opening that had areas that were difficult and it was too easy to flank and spawncamp blu
2:16:47 | Александр Виноградов: cave like closed from above
2:16:48 | dojodog: put big text on stream
2:16:50 | Some Random Dude: Moat and drawbridge like a castle
2:16:53 | Aw Man: LMAO
2:16:57 | Inc0m1ng: hi mom!
2:17:01 | (Verified, Owner) shounic: @Source engine Gamer 1000 there will be no more tf2 played on this stream today. you can leave if you are just waiting to play tf2.
2:17:03 | DeltaSatelite-96: can red have access to river from there last point spawn? 
2:17:05 | Personaless: Not this map, but in one of these we need the Doomsday Event mallet on one of the Trenches Maps
2:17:05 | DrTerror: if there was a way to delay or make it easier to predict flankings like a wall maybe? It's not easy to notice if they're trying to flank from the pyramid
2:17:12 | A Blue Nebula: hi
2:17:14 | Source engine Gamer 1000: ok
2:17:15 | DrTerror: You gotta pin that
2:17:16 | lostme: but can we play off stream?
2:17:21 | Billy: type it in another language too
2:17:25 | Yxoko: i saw a femboy pic when you alt tabbed
2:17:27 | CATALYST: add the 2nd point of badwater to blue spawn
2:17:35 | A Blue Nebula: juice galaxy insane hard if u only use morning star
2:17:41 | Some Random Dude: animated drawbridge which opens and closes on a timer
2:17:47 | dermitio: maybe add a catwalk or smth to the cliff
2:17:50 | Source engine Gamer 1000: well i joined right when the game ended
2:18:03 | DrTerror: Yeah its too overloaded with buildings which make it hard to predict when flanks happen
2:18:05 | dojodog: pretty much all of the stuff on the right side feels like it serves no purpose
2:18:06 | Metbol: turn mini spire into mega spire
2:18:08 | Hlibushok: peak map design
2:18:09 | DrTerror: but the void makes it easier I guess?
2:18:12 | Inc0m1ng: that weird moutain thing you're looking at has clipping issues btw
2:18:15 | maksu: i dont have much to add to the last point
2:18:16 | Inc0m1ng: idk wtf its called
2:18:20 | dojodog: the spiral rock is really awkward to traverse
2:18:23 | Stolen Comment Corp.: keep the badlands spire
2:18:42 | Александр Виноградов: i dont ask u a art convertion, a am about it was so stupid thet demo can just stiky spam from 1000miles avey
2:18:43 | Some Random Dude: make the pyramid explode on round end
2:18:52 | Mr.Kleiner: this is kinda awful ngl
2:19:02 | dermitio: fuck it just add the dick rock in the sky for no reason
2:19:05 | Some Random Dude: or make it a payload map with like 7 payloads before you can cap the points
2:19:05 | DrTerror: I think remove the walls where the spiral rock is because they overload the area and make it hard to see
2:19:15 | Joshua Pinkham: there is no reason to go to right route as the left route gives more cover and is quicker to get to
2:19:18 | Palook Adventures: Well, what do other maps to mitigate these problems?
2:19:20 | DrTerror: either that or remove the spiral rock itself
2:19:20 | Александр Виноградов: and cave not like art, but closed from above
2:19:25 | maksu: thanks, i tried my best too :)
2:19:33 | DrTerror: NOT THE ACTUAL WALLS the sandstone walls 
2:19:35 | Inc0m1ng: The last point would be more fun if it was smaller like point 2 and 3 are but that's a lot of work obviously lol
2:19:50 | DrTerror: My bad for not making it clear
2:20:05 | DrTerror: I dont think overall its a problem because the engis can make defenses there 
2:20:10 | DrTerror: at red spawn
2:20:15 | Sebstion: walls should be like "broken"
2:20:16 | DubiousDodo: Shoufem 
2:20:17 | Inc0m1ng: that's what I suggested basically
2:20:24 | DrTerror: That removes all the problems with the flanks
2:20:28 | DrTerror: it makes it less cluttered
2:20:28 | Some Random Dude: needs a UFO on top of pyramid
2:20:29 | (New member) Shindlers Pist: put a hunter from hl2 in the map
2:20:42 | DrTerror: it makes sightlines for sniper horrible but it was like that before 
2:20:44 | dermitio: we should never let discord do anything again
2:20:46 | Palook Adventures: That's too much of a chunk to be removed
2:20:51 | maksu: perhaps we should think about the last point more next time we playtest?
2:20:51 | Personaless: Underground way into the pyramid maybe?
2:20:54 | dojodog: Could eliminate a lot of the useless space with that idea
2:21:06 | Jackson Shipmun: this map was interesting because Trenches tactics didn't work. People were too spread out for blast damage to hit massive groups
2:21:13 | Some Random Dude: add that UFO on top of the pyramid from that one map
2:21:18 | Karl Sundkvist: holy crap lois i shounic a femboy?
2:21:25 | DrTerror: Yeah we should make a builder group for the 100 player map ideas
2:21:38 | Some Random Dude: needs that weird beam thing that the UFO does on that control point map
2:21:38 | Inc0m1ng: it would make the map better though
2:21:39 | dermitio: maybe shorten them
2:21:46 | dermitio: make them shorter
2:21:48 | DrTerror: To be fair they made the map this painful, removing some parts isnt gonna be that horrible
2:21:48 | Palook Adventures: Removing so much of the artist's stuff would be kinda disrespectful imo? As an artist.
2:21:53 | Some Random Dude: the walls outside the pyramid are fine
2:22:11 | DrTerror: It could be replaced and moved somewhere else
2:22:13 | dojodog: It's part of the process
2:22:44 | DrTerror: It has 80% of the map there already, it shouldnt be disrespectful
2:22:44 | Some Random Dude: honestly you could just copy paste more of those walls to make the pyramid further away
2:22:50 | DrTerror: you're keeping most of the map 
2:22:54 | Sebstion: just add skybox "ceiling"
2:22:56 | AlrexX extras: level design is all about making things, finding out they dont work and changing or deleting them
2:23:05 | Palook Adventures: Ahh, I suppose it''d be a shame, is what I mean. I do mean well ^^;;
2:23:05 | DrTerror: and if its that much of an issue it can be added somewhere else
2:23:07 | (New member) Shindlers Pist: let shou do what he wants
2:23:07 | Sgt Rathbone: the walls are two congested
2:23:09 | Metbol: scale up the spire so it becomes an actual powerful place to stand
2:23:09 | Elihu Eliseev: this pyramid like from evangelion, some nerv center 
2:23:15 | DrTerror: maybe as aesthetic backgrounds
2:23:22 | lostme: he found the death pit :o
2:23:25 | DrTerror: D:
2:23:26 | Some Random Dude: don't add a sky box ceiling just add downwards pushers so they break their legs
2:23:26 | Inc0m1ng: ow
2:23:32 | dermitio: :(
2:23:32 | Get on League guys: 1984
2:23:35 | Some Random Dude: oof
2:23:35 | Ghostler: aw
2:23:42 | Gabriel_Linf: Fellas, am i the only one who thinks Shounic and Lister kinda sound like one another?
2:23:42 | DubiousDodo: Would it be possible to add places where only specific classes can let the team access, like the demomans walls he can blow up in TFC
2:23:46 | Elihu Eliseev: 1984
2:23:48 | Inc0m1ng: "Chat tried making another map. It sucked so I fixed it."
2:23:48 | Joshua Pinkham: 1984
2:23:54 | DrTerror: We're really that expendable :(
2:23:56 | tommya: B-but democracy!!
2:24:07 | Stolen Comment Corp.: 1984
2:24:11 | lostme: idk why you all so pessimistic, it plays better than the initial version of dbz
2:24:19 | 0scr_: This is a Democracy Manifest!
2:24:19 | Some Random Dude: we're here for confusing mechanics
2:24:25 | CATALYST: can u jump between pyramid and glass wall
2:24:31 | DrTerror: "you guys democracied enough" thats truly what democracy is about 
2:24:51 | Yxoko: add sewers for no reason
2:25:13 | Some Random Dude: UNDERGROUND CAVES
2:25:16 | Александр Виноградов: well, its a better then 1st ed of DBZ
2:25:24 | Metbol: mini healthpacks everywhere
2:25:29 | NEmergix: why do you depict yourself as a boy with a choker
2:25:30 | Stolen Comment Corp.: tunnels
2:25:33 | Some Random Dude: vertically it's awesome
2:25:35 | AlrexX extras: i know you dont want detailing suggestions but i really want to turn this into a mayan style map
2:25:37 | Gabriel_Linf: A map with this much water seems kinda OP for Pyro sharks to play on
2:25:38 | Get on League guys: a UFO would make sense because aliens built the pyramids
2:25:42 | dojodog: maybe it's related to the server itself?
2:25:42 | dermitio: W A T E R
2:25:42 | Frost Byte: someone mentioned ing ame reds 2nd spawn to point b is a bit to far
2:25:43 | Inc0m1ng: I think the ramp someone suggested to the left of the first blu spawn was a good idea to counter the sniper watching spawn
2:25:44 | IceMoss: did we fix point 3 being capped really quickly
2:25:45 | Some Random Dude: bridges above, caves below
2:25:50 | Aw Man: yeah I think it could use more packs to pick up in general
2:25:50 | lostme: spaghet strikes yet again
2:25:51 | Frost Byte: idk if that got adressed yet
2:25:53 | Joshua Pinkham: upgrade the point 1 left building to a medium health/ammo pack
2:25:53 | Engineer12798: Add a boat that flows down the stream, that you can build sentries on
2:25:58 | Dankermemer420: source engine physics moment
2:25:58 | Pangloss: cut down on the sightlines
2:25:59 | AlrexX extras: :(
2:25:59 | Some Random Dude: if some areas could have like 3 levels of vertically that would be awesome
2:26:02 | IceMoss: because you can rush point 3 easily iirc
2:26:02 | Yxoko: remove water ,problem fixed :D (jk)
2:26:12 | IceMoss: before red can respawn in time
2:26:25 | DrTerror: I think other than my issues with first point on cave where there's too many options to flank from door entrance, which makes pushing weaker, I dont have problems
2:26:32 | Stolen Comment Corp.: if shounic removes water, we all die of thirst
2:26:37 | lostme: shounic can't tell maya and egypt apart?
2:26:40 | tommya: Imo Atzec/Mayan art looks cool
2:26:43 | DrTerror: I think decreasing the entrances from the point for blu to 2
2:26:46 | DrTerror: 3 is too much 
2:26:47 | Spring Gaming: add holes to the sandstone walls that can be fired through, it would improve visibility in that area and make it easier to hold the flank 
2:26:57 | IceMoss: alright that'll help
2:26:59 | DrTerror: yes
2:26:59 | dermitio: they are fine
2:27:00 | 0scr_: let people make it look good again
2:27:07 | Some Random Dude: make point capping times much longer like last on steel
2:27:08 | 0scr_: let them collaborate
2:27:11 | DrTerror: I think that prevents the spam there
2:27:11 | MN: the problem with the map is its so FUCKING FLAT
2:27:15 | DrTerror: that works actually well
2:27:26 | Sebstion: there should be fences too, instead of tall rock walls
2:27:47 | DrTerror: it also prevents demos and such from getting through the cave area, which was an issue as well, it was too easy to enter for red
2:27:50 | SonR3bel: i hope you are a femboy
2:27:51 | DrTerror: that fixes the issue
2:27:55 | lostme: after the evil spiral everything is flat
2:27:59 | The Great Wizard: cp_flat
2:27:59 | DrTerror: but I still think making it two entrances works
2:28:02 | SonR3bel: id love if you were a femboy
2:28:07 | SonR3bel: just saying
2:28:09 | Elihu Eliseev: make it halloween event map, maybe with MONOCULUS or hhh spawn 
2:28:13 | DrTerror: the entrance behind door stays the same 
2:28:26 | Palook Adventures: Wasn't there a terrain shifting mechanic in the Source Engine at some point? Could that be implemented?
2:28:27 | Jackson Shipmun: nonono
2:28:34 | dojodog: trigger_hurt
2:28:47 | Jackson Shipmun: you need to leave one for soldiers and demos to flank
2:28:47 | lostme: does it matter?
2:28:53 | Some Random Dude: I cant imagine what 50v50 is like with merasmus and monoculous
2:28:56 | DrTerror: It wasnt my vision exactly but its your stream so your democracy and your vision 
2:28:57 | dermitio: electric fence
2:28:57 | dojodog: i know (:
2:29:03 | DrTerror: works for me
2:29:06 | Some Random Dude: bleeding instead of dying
2:29:08 | Get on League guys: Dude wutville has a trigger_hurt like that, that's probably a sign that it's a bad idea 
2:29:13 | Jackson Shipmun: blocking them off is going to make engies way too strong there
2:29:22 | lostme: you step in the razor wire, you get hurt, that's realism :shocrossedarms:
2:29:38 | Jackson Shipmun: oh ok as long as they can jump over
2:29:47 | dermitio: welp I gtg have fun chat and shounic
2:29:47 | Mr.Kleiner: you should be able to jump over the fence
2:29:57 | Some Random Dude: boots don't stop razorwire
2:29:58 | dojodog: scout loves chewing on razor wire
2:30:01 | Get on League guys: func_nobuild the entire map 
2:30:04 | Palook Adventures: It's a barbed fence! xD
2:30:06 | Inc0m1ng: I think the ramp someone suggested to the left of the first blu spawn was a good idea to counter the sniper watching spawn
2:30:06 | Jackson Shipmun: shouldn't be able to stand, no
2:30:10 | AlrexX extras: push trigger on top
2:30:15 | Dankermemer420: push trigger?
2:30:21 | Yxoko: if they stand on them make them bleed
2:30:21 | PatGaming: The hurt for standing up there would discourage them
2:30:21 | DrTerror: at least if they are able to jump over it, its more obvious
2:30:23 | Ghostler: WHAT WAS THAT NOISE
2:30:26 | CATALYST: make the fences upside down
2:30:27 | Ghostler: I WAS DRAWING
2:30:28 | Joshua Pinkham: push trigger funny
2:30:35 | Jackson Shipmun: thanks <3
2:30:39 | DrTerror: before you just had to rocket jump and use 1 sticky and you could get up and flank
2:30:44 | Ghostler: why did he make that noise?
2:30:45 | DrTerror: now its at least more effort
2:30:54 | Jackson Shipmun: either way
2:30:59 | Joshua Pinkham: the transformation
2:31:01 | Jackson Shipmun: doesn't matter
2:31:21 | lostme: fuck, I forgot about my daily german lesson
2:31:29 | Get on League guys: it's useful for phlog cancel 
2:31:33 | AlrexX extras: trying to stand on the fence flings you to space
2:31:39 | Some Random Dude: less frustrating than not being able to jump on it
2:31:47 | pilly nutty: ive never played tf2
2:31:48 | Jackson Shipmun: I really like the one in DBZ
2:31:50 | Joshua Pinkham: thats a future problem for us
2:31:57 | Yxoko: jetpack abuse phlog?!
2:31:58 | Dr Hund: @shounic By the way, I've been experimenting on a 100 player version of Hydro, fully opened and with a twist on the gamemode, it'd be cool to playtest for experiments. Can I DM you about it somewhere?
2:31:58 | DrTerror: Actually I didnt really prefer this at first but now that I see the walls now it makes it easier for blue to hold it which was a problem before
2:32:01 | Metbol: i think a normal rocket jump is not strong enough to clear that
2:32:12 | overthegrid: I LOVE SOWING I HATE REAPING
2:32:15 | DrTerror: Red can still jump over it but engineers can put sentries there 
2:32:41 | Inc0m1ng: born to sow, forced to reap
2:32:44 | Dr Hund: I'll go take a look at that
2:32:46 | Joshua Pinkham: so true
2:32:47 | DeltaSatelite-96: Will Conquest hydro get adding? 
2:32:51 | CATALYST: turn the fences upside down
2:33:11 | Stolen Comment Corp.: will plr_2fort be added
2:33:20 | Dr Hund: Bro they litterally made the same map as me
2:33:20 | Big Mac Assassin: You should probably be high for this
2:33:21 | Some Random Dude: tf2 has NPCs?
2:33:28 | Krackin Gibbs: my cat is now laying on my arm, I am currently typing with one hand
2:33:32 | Dr Hund: except I made it prettier
2:33:33 | Rewix x: sqrt(2)
2:33:39 | Super Sain: add 2fort battlements
2:33:41 | ValETC: TF2 has NPCs, it's the playerbase.
2:33:48 | Dankermemer420: hydro is kinda mid anyway
2:33:50 | Inc0m1ng: my team always has npc's in it
2:34:05 | lostme: there's 99 npcs every time I join :shoCrossedArms:
2:34:05 | Pompmaker1: youngsters these days
2:34:07 | AlrexX extras: YUP
2:34:07 | DeltaSatelite-96: lol
2:34:14 | Aw Man: lmao
2:34:17 | dojodog: that is terrifying
2:34:17 | Yxoko: perfect
2:34:18 | Get on League guys: team rocket blasting off 
2:34:21 | Александр Виноградов: atom punch
2:34:21 | DrTerror: LOL
2:34:24 | overthegrid: 1000000000000hammer units/s
2:34:26 | Some Random Dude: Big funny
2:34:26 | Pompmaker1: extremely cute scream
2:34:30 | DrTerror: You'd literally think your game is trolling you 
2:34:32 | Dankermemer420: perfect dont change it
2:34:33 | DrTerror: thats hilarious
2:34:34 | DrTerror: keep it in
2:34:34 | Joshua Pinkham: decrease speed of push
2:34:41 | Stolen Comment Corp.: keep it
2:34:43 | maksu: make it a hurt trigger because its a barbed wire
2:34:44 | Rewix x: the new tf sqrt(2)
2:35:01 | Eco: why is the femboy still there goddamn
2:35:07 | Dankermemer420: leaked femboy folder?
2:35:10 | poopideeshroop: :3
2:35:14 | DrTerror: I think my problems with the map were when you could push at red point and they could flank you as well, but I dont think thats a map issue but the team issue
2:35:20 | DrTerror: it was fixed when you added the blockades 
2:35:43 | Some Random Dude: if tf2 is based on half life does that mean it's possible to drive vehicles in tf2?
2:36:00 | Dankermemer420: probably
2:36:05 | maksu: i dont think shos gonna care for my ideas after i made the last point
2:36:17 | DrTerror: Imagine Soldier actually being able to drive a tank on a map
2:36:22 | Some Random Dude: w h a t
2:36:22 | Dr Hund: Some guy made working tanks and planes without func_vehicle and they're pretty cool
2:36:27 | HappyFaceTaco: utfyghjkl
2:36:30 | Get on League guys: yet
2:36:34 | tommya: Make Wacky Races great againa
2:36:39 | lostme: bonk
2:36:40 | lostme: lmao
2:36:43 | Get on League guys: love me some Wacky Races
2:36:53 | DrTerror: Its more effort which it wasnt before
2:36:53 | Dankermemer420: maybe a touch too much???
2:36:56 | Some Random Dude: the wacky race maps are fun af
2:37:11 | Get on League guys: Well do you have any better ideas 
2:37:14 | Some Random Dude: maybe this map could use a hot air balloon which travels around the map
2:37:16 | Stolen Comment Corp.: we just hate snipers
2:37:24 | DrTerror: The map has loads of problems in itself so at most its a solid solution for now
2:37:38 | DrTerror: like you said its not going to be the only time we're doing it
2:37:40 | Dark: shounic likes making fun of us
2:37:40 | Joshua Pinkham: you don't have to make the push trigger too strong since the fence is hard to stand on
2:38:00 | Get on League guys: party like its 2007 
2:38:01 | Krackin Gibbs: tuesday moment
2:38:23 | Super Sain: how much money to change the "I'm not a femboy" text to "I am a femboy"
2:38:26 | tommya: Chewsday innit
2:38:33 | DrTerror: I was about to hop off 
2:38:38 | Inc0m1ng: you gotta play 2048 before you leave man
2:38:45 | yourpancake: you need to meow for the audience first
2:38:48 | dojodog: are you going to upload the updated map after stream??
2:38:50 | maksu: i think its fine for the next playtest, whenever that happens
2:38:53 | Get on League guys: Meow for the audience 
2:38:54 | Some Random Dude: needs moving walls
2:39:02 | Dr Hund: I'm still bummed that I spilt my blood on Hydro just so that I could learned that someone already did it but barely changed anything and I can't playtest it with 100 people
2:39:04 | DrTerror: thanks for taking in my suggestions even though I wasn't very clear on them by the way, I had fun brainstorming.
2:39:08 | Super Sain: you have to play 2048
2:39:09 | Some Random Dude: not enough maps are interactive
2:39:09 | Yxoko: delete the map and replace by 2fort, problem solved (jk)
2:39:11 | lostme: balatro stream
2:39:14 | DrTerror: Im gonna go to sleep now
2:39:19 | Александр Виноградов: 2048
2:39:22 | Super Sain: femboy 🫵
2:39:22 | Joshua Pinkham: it would be hard to counter strafe on the fence since you have people constantly shooting at you
2:39:24 | pilly nutty: its time for us to entertain the streamer now 
2:39:26 | Some Random Dude: the ones with buttons which do things are cool af

2:40:14 | DrTerror: You should make a community post about it
2:40:17 | catswork: the pipeline to turbine to turbine winter succession goes hard
2:40:19 | TUNRAX: femboy moment
2:40:20 | Aw Man: these idiots only vote for the same shit over and over again removing the dupes is ok lmao
2:40:23 | DrTerror: I wouldnt mind seeing it for fun

2:40:37 | Dark: i just joined the stream lmfao
2:40:37 | werecat: what did you say about the pipeline thing?
2:40:38 | Dankermemer420: ?
2:40:42 | Pompmaker1: the femboy pipeline?
2:40:46 | dojodog: i dont believe i caught the pipeline thing
2:40:48 | Get on League guys: Beware the pipeline
2:40:50 | Super Sain: pipeline? like your femboy transformation pipeline?
2:40:58 | Joshua Pinkham: shounic knows a lot about pipelines
2:41:01 | Dankermemer420: about 30 minutes after it started?
2:41:06 | AJ: Like five minutes ago
2:41:09 | DrTerror: I joined first thing, I was waiting the entire day to playtest
2:41:10 | Super Sain: "new"
2:41:12 | lostme: the stream started just 2 hours ago, what?
2:41:15 | Kai Gao: I just got here lol
2:41:16 | dojodog: I caught the stream sort of late
2:41:16 | catswork: i just joined
2:41:17 | DrTerror: I was excited
2:41:19 | Some Random Dude: pipeline?
2:41:42 | Dr Hund: I was there for the first one and I uhh left my print, infortunately
2:41:53 | Krackin Gibbs: according to youtube: "144 watching now Started streaming 2 hours ago"
2:42:08 | Valles: poop

2:42:41 | Super Sain: @Ghostler art progress update?
2:42:48 | Meow Paw: tf2 64 bit update when :3
2:42:51 | yourpancake: femnic
2:42:57 | (Verified) Richter Overtime: shounic what would ur advice be to a youtuber wanting to open a public source engine server ...
2:42:58 | Joshua Pinkham: we should definitely add shipment from COD:MW to the trenches 
2:42:59 | Some Random Dude: fair
2:43:05 | HadesReturn: metro boomin make it boom
2:43:07 | Attack Walrus: Shounic you have to save tf2
2:43:18 | DrTerror: As of right now you cant do that
2:43:21 | Joshua Pinkham: no it's a fake
2:43:21 | DrTerror: we're still pretty neew
2:43:30 | DrTerror: It's more organized to do it, but you could have someone own it and you can just view over it
2:43:38 | tommya: :face-purple-crying:
2:43:40 | Get on League guys: maybe the real saving tf2 was the friends we made along the way 
2:43:41 | Александр Виноградов: man u doin great
2:44:02 | Attack Walrus: No richter overtime is not real
2:44:05 | (Verified) Richter Overtime: lol when did that happen
2:44:14 | Super Sain: shounic you NEED to become a femboy to #savetf2
2:44:22 | DrTerror: Thats honestly a good idea, it'd be flexible
2:44:24 | Inc0m1ng: Only think I would unironically recommend is the ramp someone mentioned to the left of the first blu spawn to counter the sniper and engies
2:44:25 | Super Sain: all the bots will leave if you become a femboy
2:44:35 | Get on League guys: can we mod @Super Sain 
2:44:44 | E Bux: you realize you can just turn off the stream and not have to be a femboy smh
2:44:45 | DrTerror: Sure. Its win-win for everyone 
2:44:49 | Dr Hund: So a map submission mailbox where we can put our maps for playtest?
2:44:58 | Some Random Dude: is it possible to combine all of the gamemodes? like ctf control point, payload, and player destruction in the same map
2:45:05 | Super Sain: @Get on League guys fr
2:45:17 | DR: @abinari pleaseee please please thigh reveall
2:45:22 | Dr Hund: hmm... maybe things are not lost after all
2:45:35 | DDA 123: The issue is we would have little to no maps as most of su cant map
2:45:37 | nequ: :chillwcat:
2:45:38 | Charmy The Charizard: Why did shounic become a femboy on the corner of the stream?
2:45:41 | Super Sain: @E Bux why would he do that if he likes being a femboy
2:45:48 | Attack Walrus: Shounic are you friends with rick tor overtime
2:46:03 | DrTerror: So like a mapping sub-group that people can help the mappers on and you playtest
2:46:12 | Dr Hund: honestly there are so many community made TF2 maps out there that just go nowhere, it just makes me real sad
2:46:14 | Joshua Pinkham: @Charmy The Charizard capitalism
2:46:35 | Charmy The Charizard: @Joshua Pinkham Explains everything

2:55:42 | Inc0m1ng: he didn't want to do 2048 so he did poker instead
2:55:51 | Dark: true but it is an hand
2:55:53 | BlueKirbvii: it depends on the run if i go for endless

2:57:21 | BlueKirbvii: its good early game, not much after
2:58:25 | Jupiter Stupider: What’s the celestial pack?
2:58:29 | Krackin Gibbs: if you keep the knife joker to the right of your other jokers, it shouldn't sacrifice anything
2:58:42 | BlueKirbvii: popcorn for early mult? atleast until something better
2:58:53 | Jupiter Stupider: Cool

3:01:11 | lostme: MORE STONKS?
3:01:37 | lostme: yes, flush gaming
3:02:08 | BlueKirbvii: it would be more X of a kind rather than flush, no? it was rank not suit
3:02:09 | Dark: literally flushing
3:02:09 | lostme: you fool
3:02:19 | Dark: full house
3:02:59 | That windows XP fan: I am back

3:07:50 | Dark: keep playing 2 pairs ig
3:08:04 | Dark: true
3:08:38 | lostme: you can use the fifth slot to discard garbage if you don't use it in the combo
3:08:46 | BlueKirbvii: i honestly forget that hands give money, i just float above 25 and get interest
3:09:12 | MinecraftMania: New facecam:face-blue-smiling:
3:10:01 | Bobo: goddamn gambler....

3:12:18 | maki: is this like super auto pets but with cards?
3:13:10 | Inc0m1ng: its the poker sequel we needed 
3:13:18 | Dark: high card got like 50% wtf
3:14:03 | Dark: wtf
3:14:18 | lostme: high card build :O
3:14:29 | Dark: literally high card for the win
3:14:33 | Krackin Gibbs: thin to win?
3:14:35 | Bobo: how much money do you make from these gamblings?
3:15:01 | Bobo: krazy
3:16:37 | lostme: planet cards were nicely strong last time I checked
3:17:00 | lostme: especially when you thin the deck like this
3:17:18 | Dark: now we gamble
3:17:19 | Jake Staheli: hey, on your 100 player server I'm getting tired of not being able to play pl dbz because it was played 15 matches ago. would you consider making the recently played system slightly less restrictive?
3:18:03 | Jake Staheli: dang unlucky
3:18:04 | Krackin Gibbs: increasing card rank is another way you can get more face cards
3:19:55 | Krackin Gibbs: mult makes number go brrrr more
3:20:14 | Dark: 4 of a kind > flush i think
3:20:24 | lostme: smaller of the two numbers is more important
3:20:51 | lostme: I saw aliensrock make mul bigger than chips
3:21:00 | Pompmaker1: I love how naturally shounic has turned into a variety gaming vtuber
3:21:02 | Dark: rip build
3:21:04 | Krackin Gibbs: makes sense, in normal poker it isn't easy to get the same card from each suit
3:21:33 | Dark: its joeover
3:21:48 | Pompmaker1: rip
3:22:13 | Dark: its so over
3:22:17 | Krackin Gibbs: F
3:22:21 | BlueKirbvii: sa
3:22:22 | Pompmaker1: gg
3:22:24 | BlueKirbvii: damn*
3:22:24 | Dark: ggs
3:22:29 | Krackin Gibbs: you got greedy with the face cards
3:22:32 | Inc0m1ng: skill diff
3:22:37 | Pompmaker1: it's so sad when your favorite vtubers lose at games
3:23:03 | BlueKirbvii: yeah thats really it i think
3:23:22 | Krackin Gibbs: multiple bosses debuff certain types of cards, there is always a chance your deck will get hard countered
3:23:24 | Dark: you should do this more often
3:23:24 | lostme: just one more
3:23:31 | lostme: 5 more minutes mom please
3:23:35 | Dark: i gotta go to prepare for a concert
3:23:40 | Inc0m1ng: you could play 2048 instead
3:23:42 | BlueKirbvii: but its okay because this game is peak
3:23:42 | Inc0m1ng: easier to understand
3:23:43 | Krackin Gibbs: so... diversifying at least a bit seems like a good idea
3:23:44 | Joshua Pinkham: yes
3:24:09 | Krackin Gibbs: also, I also vote more balatro
3:24:27 | Krackin Gibbs: so if you win you'll do another?
3:24:37 | lostme: shounic is done for :o
3:25:33 | Dark: damn
3:25:39 | Kay: what's this game?
3:25:48 | Inc0m1ng: so much for only one more game
3:25:51 | BlueKirbvii: damnn
3:25:52 | Krackin Gibbs: *soldier trombone taunts*
3:25:54 | lostme: if you used empty slots to reroll cards you would've had it :)
3:25:56 | Dark: credit card would of been useful here
3:26:27 | lostme: "if I lose I'm leaving"
3:27:00 | Krackin Gibbs: coward
3:27:31 | Krackin Gibbs: not making do with what you were given
3:27:34 | Lgmrszd: I tabbed away why shounic is gambling now
3:27:41 | Dark: cause he can
3:27:49 | Lgmrszd: power move
3:28:19 | lostme: forced to not missplay :o
3:28:55 | lostme: torn joker + high card best strat
3:29:10 | Dr Hund: alright off I go

3:29:19 | Dark: the braindead strats are the funniest
3:29:27 | Dark: bye
3:30:53 | Joshua Pinkham: not letting interest gib money
3:31:27 | Solres: It's good, until you get unlucky
3:31:28 | Cargo Plane: edging to that weird cat in the corner rn
3:31:35 | Pompmaker1: would you ever add VSH to the 100 player server?
3:31:52 | Dark: vsh was added on the 100 player server, but it wasnt fun iirc
3:32:16 | Inc0m1ng: wish I could of tried it cause it sounds fun lol
3:32:21 | Inc0m1ng: at least to me
3:32:31 | EvGen: Why didn't you show up your femboy character fully?
3:32:35 | Dark: its sounds fun until you die 4 seconds in and wait in spectator for like a year
3:32:48 | Inc0m1ng: that's pretty fair actually
3:32:51 | Kay: shounic how do the pet heads work with lip sync?

3:33:36 | Solres: Never bought it / ante is "floor"
3:33:37 | Dark: time travel
3:33:40 | Joshua Pinkham: let interest stonks
3:33:46 | SleepyEngi: shounic is literaly jokermodding

3:34:42 | Pompmaker1: what do you normally order at macdonalds?
3:34:43 | Krackin Gibbs: you're still kind of early game
3:34:44 | Dark: this is the poker update
3:34:47 | Solres: Hiker is one of the few ways to scale up chips, but it's late game
3:34:55 | Joshua Pinkham: delayed gratification more money for interest
3:35:05 | lostme: retrigger + hearts
3:35:07 | Joshua Pinkham: all in greed
3:35:13 | lostme: extra chance on 1/3
3:35:23 | Dark: we love gambling
3:35:23 | Kay: How do the animal heads lip sync? I don't know any source thingy mig jigs
3:35:31 | Solres: Retrigger is safest I guess
3:35:43 | Inc0m1ng: we play tf2, of course we love gambling
3:35:47 | EvGen: I wanna see that femboy-shounic fully. I've seen you has the strip stockings :D

3:38:14 | Solres: Supernova scales ok, and it's a mult
3:38:23 | lostme: but supernova probably better
3:38:32 | Kay: weird question. Do you edit your videos or get someone else to edit?
3:39:34 | Joshua Pinkham: vampire joker will keep stealing enhancements that give mult
3:40:02 | lostme: you underuse the celestial packs
3:40:03 | Joshua Pinkham: you need base mult
3:40:28 | Solres: Sort bu suit if you're looking for flush

3:48:26 | FreeAndLit: its shover
3:48:27 | Solres: Joever
3:48:50 | Pentaperno: Why everyone I know of is playing Blatro
3:48:53 | Pompmaker1: the femboy's expression matches your exasperation perfectly
3:48:55 | Inc0m1ng: who knew that a game about gambling means loosing to chance
3:49:04 | Krackin Gibbs: weird how getting screwed over by rng is fun in balatro but not in tf2
3:49:09 | Inc0m1ng: ayo?
3:49:12 | Inc0m1ng: when?
3:49:25 | Pentaperno: Oh feisty!
3:49:32 | Yoloc4th: raaagh
3:49:33 | Pompmaker1: I remain
3:49:39 | RazorbladeFlamingo: Uhhh, john
3:49:43 | Solres: urh, tf2 again, I wanted balatro
3:49:50 | RazorbladeFlamingo: Play John
3:49:58 | Krackin Gibbs: how about... an arena map?
3:50:09 | Yoloc4th: pd
3:50:10 | Inc0m1ng: I recommend koth modes cause attack/defend maps get raped once enginner is picked
3:50:12 | Pompmaker1: class wars but remove spy, sniper and medic so no one has to suffer
3:50:19 | KatiePlayz_: wagoo wagooo whats up
3:50:20 | RazorbladeFlamingo: Gibbs you're sadistic
3:50:23 | FreeAndLit: upward
3:50:31 | Yoloc4th: hydro
3:50:36 | Pompmaker1: egypt sounds good for 100p class wars
3:50:42 | Pompmaker1: lakeside
3:50:42 | RazorbladeFlamingo: 100 players classwars?
3:50:44 | Joshua Pinkham: class wars but each team gets guaranteed one of each class
3:50:47 | lostme: dbz :shocrossedarms:
3:50:51 | Yoloc4th: hydroooooooooooooooooooo
3:50:56 | Pompmaker1: lakeside is a good one
3:51:02 | Frost Byte: highpass?
3:51:04 | KatiePlayz_: :face-blue-wide-eyes:
3:51:12 | Pompmaker1: hightower
3:51:19 | Yoloc4th: suijin
3:51:25 | Krackin Gibbs: @RazorbladeFlamingo I mean, I did P-rank P-2 in ultrakill on violent.... although I guess that's more masochistic that sadistic
3:51:27 | RazorbladeFlamingo: 100 players but your class is randomized every respawn?
3:51:33 | Krackin Gibbs: badlands
3:51:35 | KatiePlayz_: product
3:51:42 | RazorbladeFlamingo: @Krackin Gibbs Holy crap, you poor bastard
3:51:47 | Inc0m1ng: swiftwater might work too
3:51:53 | Krackin Gibbs: product?
3:52:08 | RazorbladeFlamingo: Highpass 102%
3:52:12 | Yoloc4th: then why did you ask us
3:52:12 | Krackin Gibbs: or whatever the comp version of viaduct is called
3:52:32 | Yoloc4th: how dare you have an opinion smh
3:52:38 | RazorbladeFlamingo: Well, I'm not sure, I'm not good at ideas
3:52:43 | Inc0m1ng: "I forget that i don't have to listen to you guys" in your own words lmao
3:53:03 | Yoloc4th: walmart_bettermeme
3:53:31 | Col. Klink 1965: Everyone sleeping on Lakeside
3:53:32 | Pompmaker1: koth_deezmocracy would be good
3:53:33 | RazorbladeFlamingo: DeeBeeZee was an ok map
3:53:39 | Pompmaker1: deezmocracy is a koth
3:53:49 | Inc0m1ng: you sound like hakita now lmao
3:53:54 | Motivated: what was the vote for, just came back
3:53:56 | Aw Man: wait we changing the map list in trench server? :3
3:54:21 | Sniper FromTF2: are you sure you're not a femboy?
3:54:27 | Aw Man: oh ok :3
3:54:27 | lostme: shounic's natural submissiveness surfaced, true femboy
3:54:27 | Pompmaker1: are you gonna put rtd in it?
3:54:40 | Col. Klink 1965: But isn't Highpass just Lakeside but different?
3:54:46 | Joshua Pinkham: spoiler alert engineer is the best class stacked
3:54:49 | Yoloc4th: do the lore of femboy shou
3:54:52 | Pompmaker1: nice, rtd sucks
3:55:10 | Pompmaker1: But isnt' Gorge just Upward but different?
3:55:23 | FreeAndLit: sawmill
3:55:26 | Motivated: i like lakes
3:55:28 | Inc0m1ng: i still think viaduct works better in case sniper is picked but highpass would be the second best
3:55:31 | Col. Klink 1965: Highpass and Lakeside both have that flat elevated control point
3:55:32 | RazorbladeFlamingo: Because 
3:55:40 | lostme: isn't dbz just 2fort but different?
3:55:44 | Inc0m1ng: sniper usually looses in class wars but viaduct gives them a slight chance if they play well
3:55:44 | Jackson Shipmun: dunno about class wars. In general it's because lakeside is hard for engies to lock down
3:55:47 | Pompmaker1: yeah, that was why I suggested it
3:55:50 | Krackin Gibbs: harvest >:)
3:55:53 | RazorbladeFlamingo: Or a 5cp, a 5cp could work
3:56:03 | Pompmaker1: Take the true chaos option, go Nucleus
3:56:27 | Inc0m1ng: in that case go wutville
3:56:42 | Pompmaker1: fuck it, 2fort
3:56:55 | Arenovas: Do eyeaduct for max chaos
3:57:00 | Krackin Gibbs: test with bots?
3:57:04 | LilDreamer: make it tr_walkway
3:57:06 | Yoloc4th: suijin >:(
3:57:18 | Pompmaker1: deezmocracy
3:57:42 | Inc0m1ng: depends on the class though if its class wars
3:57:49 | Pompmaker1: in that case we should do a payload race instead
3:57:51 | Inc0m1ng: its easier for them to take if its soldiers taking against sniper
3:58:05 | why bro: achievement_engineer
3:58:11 | Pompmaker1: I unironically recomment hightower
3:58:20 | Joshua Pinkham: shou is easily swayed by the poll
3:58:29 | Yoloc4th: brazil
3:58:32 | Jackson Shipmun: ugliness is true and should be taken into account
3:58:41 | Yoloc4th: hightower 100%
3:58:44 | lostme: highertower :sholl:
3:58:45 | Jackson Shipmun: gotta keep the YouTube video in mind
3:58:50 | Inc0m1ng: viaduct is best map cause snow and snow is cool
3:58:51 | Pompmaker1: highesttower
3:58:56 | Krackin Gibbs: pipeline.... or whatever that nighttime oen with a similar look to doublecross is called
3:59:01 | Yoloc4th: king
3:59:16 | Motivated: femboy pipeline
3:59:20 | Krackin Gibbs: uhhh.... banana bay?
3:59:22 | Yoloc4th: sawmil
3:59:27 | Yoloc4th: cloak

3:59:49 | Anemic Fiend: what are we talking about
3:59:49 | Inc0m1ng: I don't know many people who hate banana bay
3:59:52 | David I: Who's they?
3:59:54 | Krackin Gibbs: banananananananana baaaaaaaayy!!
4:00:06 | Motivated: i feel like at the end of banana bay itll just get stuck at the train
4:00:11 | Inc0m1ng: ignore them lmao
4:00:23 | Krackin Gibbs: ....wot
4:00:30 | Krackin Gibbs: yt comments are that deranged?

4:01:12 | Arenovas: Gotta make one with chat to use
4:01:24 | Krackin Gibbs: ...I don't think I've ever actually played that map, actually
4:01:45 | Krackin Gibbs: oh wait, it's that sawmill-looking map
4:01:46 | Krackin Gibbs: ah
4:01:46 | Inc0m1ng: a territoral map could also work, but not something like hydro lmao
4:01:50 | Yoloc4th: koth_king
4:02:02 | Col. Klink 1965: Fuck it, we're going to Hydro
4:02:06 | ReimuHakureiShrine: chat are we stupid?

4:03:11 | Joshua Pinkham: a halloween map but disable the halloween
4:03:19 | Inc0m1ng: every map gets fucked by engies to be fair
4:03:25 | Jack Carfrey:  what’s this stream for?

4:04:07 | Jack Carfrey: i don’t even know why i asked
4:04:09 | Source engine Gamer 1000: shounic should we do tf2 hightower

4:05:17 | Krackin Gibbs: also, you sure you're not thinking of rotunda? pretty sure cascade isn't that circular
4:05:19 | Joshua Pinkham: democracy at its finest
4:05:22 | Aw Man: not my fault that people are not watching the stream :3
4:05:28 | Hepoy: i never heard of koth_king

4:08:11 | Inc0m1ng: just not a wednesday either
4:08:19 | Arenovas: I don't have free time on weekends
4:08:32 | Inc0m1ng: thursday was pretty packed for the workshop map stream
4:08:32 | Joshua Pinkham: if you were to do a 12h stream do it on a weekend so more people will be available
4:08:35 | Jack Carfrey: thursday!
4:08:41 | Arenovas: Magic of work on weekends
4:09:09 | why bro: somebody made aimbot with vscript lmao

4:09:23 | Jack Carfrey: do thursday trust 
4:09:26 | Source engine Gamer 1000: ru gonna play any tf2 in this stream? or not this stream either
4:09:54 | Frost Byte: its about over
4:09:59 | Krackin Gibbs: @Source engine Gamer 1000 you missed the TF2
4:09:59 | Inc0m1ng: I think it looks like a older video hence the lack of attention since the thumbnail is the exact same as the older video
4:10:01 | Coaster Time: there's sort of a feburary low period
4:10:05 | Coaster Time: on youtube
4:10:10 | lostme: it's kinda less interesting second time
4:10:16 | Lutho: how did the video perform bad, im being honest it didnt even show on my yt front page
4:10:16 | Joshua Pinkham: i came for the videos but now I'm more interested in the streams
4:10:30 | ArmmoonPE: i don’t get your videos in my recommended as much
4:10:31 | LilDreamer: college midterms
4:10:36 | Yoloc4th: schools back in, less breaks right after december
4:10:39 | Jack Carfrey: do you think that 64 bit tf2 will enable the botters even more by making the game easier to run?
4:10:49 | AlrexX extras: i was litrerally gonna watch it after the stream
4:10:50 | Pompmaker1: february is a bad time for vtubers in general, now that you've become one you're getting hit by it too
4:10:53 | Inc0m1ng: could also be new interest in the 100 player server so people only care about the trenches instead of the experiments
4:10:53 | Col. Klink 1965: YouTube February depression
4:11:08 | Yoloc4th: ive had 3 midterms in the past 2 weeks
4:11:21 | medicami: I did seriously think it was the old video again, but you just changed the thumbnail and title
4:11:22 | lostme: shounic is a tsundere :3
4:11:28 | Source engine Gamer 1000: will you play another tf2 game in this live shounic or no
4:11:29 | iuri menezes dos santos pereira iuri: tf2 100 players
4:11:43 | LilDreamer: teach me about algorithms so I can study for my midterms
4:11:49 | Inc0m1ng: at least change the thumbnail cause it looks the same as the old one
4:11:50 | Col. Klink 1965: Shounic Vtuber not real?
4:12:04 | medicami: maybe that part was just cut off on mobile

4:21:33 | Inc0m1ng: brain hurty
4:21:44 | Source engine Gamer 1000: whats ur opinion on children in tf2?

4:24:11 | null: did you test democracy 3 yet sho
4:24:13 | Lgmrszd: you can put discord link on github pages and then link github changes
4:24:23 | Arenovas: I'd be up for it
4:24:23 | Lgmrszd: that way when discord link updates you just update github pages
4:24:24 | grillcheese: shounic can i clean your balls
4:24:57 | Source engine Gamer 1000: shounic is sonic

4:26:33 | Some Random Dude: debian best
4:26:57 | lostme: @Lgmrszd I didn't start the fire, it was always burning
4:27:09 | Source engine Gamer 1000: tf2 takes way longer than urs to load, search OptiPlex 3070 specs, those are my specs, ittakes 2 mins to load tf2
4:27:34 | Joshua Pinkham: classic over explaining what's immediately visible to distract chat from wanting to know more
4:27:35 | Some Random Dude: probably best to use docker for that
4:27:39 | Yoloc4th: i am ascared of that ordinarygamers thumbnail
4:27:49 | Jack Carfrey: what are you specs
4:27:50 | Inc0m1ng: he's distracting to waste time instead of playing 2048 
4:27:58 | lostme: hey shounic, mind giving me a discord role with #313338 colour?
4:28:00 | Jack Carfrey: ^
4:28:02 | Yoloc4th: play 2048 
4:28:03 | grillcheese: dude its 2 am here how is it 6 pm for ya
4:28:14 | Jack Carfrey: i meant to up arrow the 2048 
4:28:21 | The Overmind: why is he not playing 2048
4:28:24 | Krackin Gibbs: do not the code
4:28:40 | Fricks: don't worry, we're too stupid to know what to do with the bot token
4:28:58 | Some Random Dude: your supposed to use environment variables so you can't accidentally leak tokens
4:29:01 | gort: the j
4:29:03 | Source engine Gamer 1000: i hate my pc in tf2 when theres alot of players, my game has alot of small spikes, my cpu is a T one, my gpu is onboard/intergrated
4:29:14 | Inc0m1ng: its a token so you spend it obviously
4:29:14 | decrpt: there are too many anthony fantanos in the recommendations
4:29:24 | Some Random Dude: to be fair tho my first discord bot had the token in the python file
4:29:25 | Lgmrszd: slapping shit together is a real programming
4:29:32 | Joshua Pinkham: spoken like a true programmer
4:29:37 | Some Random Dude: Best way to get started
4:29:38 | Krackin Gibbs: I mean, isn't that what programming is? throwing shit to the wall and see what sticks?
4:29:48 | Nimble Snek: "just slapping shit together" clearly a real programmer
4:29:51 | lostme: dwindling sanity of discord bot programmers :O
4:29:54 | UnluckyBean: gpt think for me
4:30:07 | Inc0m1ng: my code teacher would kill me if i used gpt in any way lmao
4:30:21 | UnluckyBean: i should ask gpt to dream for me
4:30:23 | decrpt: yeah, anything that doesn't pose security threats or isn't super complex is great for gpt
4:30:27 | Source engine Gamer 1000: shounic whats ur opinion on children in tf2?
4:30:37 | Some Random Dude: GPT would have been useful when I started programming
4:30:39 | Source engine Gamer 1000: oh
4:30:41 | Ulexos: bing's gpt can very quickly do inaccurate math lol i asked it to get the average out of a couple numbers and it was off by 2 or sth
4:31:36 | Some Random Dude: that is pretty much what every student in my CS class is like
4:31:38 | medicami: lmao thats what i learned in post secondary, html, css, JS and java
4:31:50 | lostme: on the other hand you can ask GPT for explanations like a person
4:31:55 | decrpt: chatgpt also sucks at anything more complicated than if x, do y
4:32:20 | Krackin Gibbs: well, there are """artists""" out there that use AI to make things and think they're great despite not knowing anything bout making art without AI
4:32:21 | UnluckyBean: how many times have you been called a femboy man that one text over your avatar is funny
4:32:26 | Jack Carfrey: my last coding class we had to write down code on paper for the tests :skull:
4:32:34 | Inc0m1ng: I can make a program that converts farenheit to celsius, good enough for me
4:32:38 | Kay: pug
4:32:46 | Krackin Gibbs: so.... a similar scenario with programming isn't that far out there
4:32:54 | Some Random Dude: GPT is also pretty useless for cursed programming languages like Haskell
4:33:02 | Jack Carfrey: i asked gpt for ap chem help and it literally just gave me a wrong answer
4:33:04 | decrpt: chatgpt is lowkey amazing with spreadsheet automation for my job
4:33:25 | Col. Klink 1965: GPT can do errors in it's code and if it can't fix it then neither can you because you're dumb and never learned to code.
4:33:33 | Some Random Dude: The more niche the knowledge the less useful GPT is
4:33:33 | Kay: how much money does the 100 player server cost?
4:33:47 | Source engine Gamer 1000: fgtrrr v (i think a cat stepped onmykeyboard while i was with my brother
4:33:54 | Inc0m1ng: isn't it around 400 for the server
4:34:11 | bunnyman14: I just got here and I see that Shounic is no longer a literal cat.
4:34:38 | Joshua Pinkham: @bunnyman14 see last stream for context
4:34:40 | zzziplok: ¿why is you a kawai cat anime drawing?
4:34:42 | Some Random Dude: it does seem to know some things which it shouldn't its more the reasoning about it that it sucks at
4:34:44 | Source engine Gamer 1000: it just said 69 watching then went down
4:34:44 | Kay: he is a femboys he is just hiding it
4:34:46 | Joshua Pinkham: money
4:34:51 | FreeAndLit: bye bye
4:34:53 | bunnyman14: Oh boy time to play catch-up
4:34:54 | Some Random Dude: like it can only to a problem in one way
