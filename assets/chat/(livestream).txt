1:25:00 | coolguy : if its right then spam the emoji
1:25:12 | Taureon: why doesnt the aimbot plugin just assume that the guns hit the head hitbox if there is a line of sight? that sounds more consistent than turning the player to look at the enemy heads

1:34:42 | H&FP: can i have a femboy sandvich?
1:34:43 | FloatlessKiwi: close one
1:34:44 | Noise (not fake): @Delta Time spend 5 dollars to make shonic femboy name a weapon femboyinator

4:24:52 | tommya: Epic gamer moment :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:
4:25:12 | Dizzy formula: “Dbz”? Is this that goku them kids talk about
4:25:16 | Kritzmaker: shounic why does sitting on top of the cart work
4:25:32 | m: do you have a mii? wow
4:25:44 | (New member) Shamus: are you adding perks to the patreon 
4:25:54 | Phosphorus51: The mercs have magnets in their feet that drive a motor in the cart 
4:26:08 | Inc0m1ng: it makes sense, thank you very much :)
4:26:27 | Kritzmaker: shounic could it theoretically work to replace complex brushes with models and visbrushes?
4:27:18 | m: ypu should add a mii, ow
4:27:22 | InsecureBroccoli: make chat do it
4:27:32 | Golden Bendy: can we get gordos paidman in team fort the second
4:27:35 | Dizzy formula: thoughts on the tf2 dog trade

4:29:01 | Metalclaw: *sadge*
4:29:18 | Golden Bendy: can we get gordos paidman in team fort the second
4:29:21 | Retro blue: shounic I have returned from the future to once again request 3000$
4:29:32 | Xnery: clearing that cave is hard as blu team
4:29:38 | m: will you Adress the contivercy?
4:29:53 | plsplsplslol: its impossible to clear but they should ignore it
4:30:02 | tommya: contivercy LUL
4:30:09 | Edoan: truly a (livestram)
4:30:11 | Xnery: red engies would make a nest there during setup time
4:30:23 | m: i hate the Letter i
4:30:32 | m: its always in the way of o
4:30:39 | Jaimer: hello

4:31:07 | Dizzy formula: fill it with water?
4:31:08 | m: Im going to pass on
4:31:11 | plsplsplslol: close the door until the cart reaches the point
4:31:13 | Kritzmaker: nobuild in random spots is the equivalent of anti-homeless architecture to engineers
4:31:13 | Foxo: maybe make the one way shutter in the back a two way door?
4:31:24 | Phosphorus51: Imagine map consisting entirely of one-way doors that prevent both teams from retreating. They'd need to be team specific so Blu can actually push through the whole map
4:31:26 | Dizzy formula: lmao true
4:31:54 | m: there is some false information floating above your head!
4:32:00 | Yxoko: shounic what if someone donate 500ù$ right now what would be your reaction?
4:32:01 | Kinetic Kid: did you get shot by a Japanizing beam
4:32:02 | Foxo: the smaller shutter door on the side of the cliff, the one you just exited from
4:32:11 | Yxoko: ignore the ù
4:32:11 | Golden Bendy: yeah bro get rid of the fake info on top of your head
4:32:26 | Xnery: i think removing the non-one-way door would solve 
4:32:28 | Worm enjoyer2015: someone hasnt mentioned him being a femboy in a while
4:32:45 | FortressSins (Formerly twomoose.).: hes a femboy
4:32:55 | Edoan: the title of the stream is clickbait
4:32:58 | Dizzy formula: we don’t need to point out the obvious..
4:33:01 | Pompmaker1: I'm drawing cat maid femboy shounic right not
4:33:02 | m: whats your killbind botton?
4:33:03 | Pompmaker1: *now
4:33:13 | Golden Bendy: no
4:33:17 | plsplsplslol: lets goo
4:33:17 | Golden Bendy: don't do it pomp
4:33:23 | Xnery: what makes it hard to clear it is that blu team doesnt have a clear line of sight to destroy the nest
4:33:23 | Yoloc4th: why are you still streaming lmao
4:33:36 | Vaan: more toilets, in this economy?
4:33:41 | Xnery: so by removing the two way door entirely would theoretically make it like dustbowl
4:33:42 | FreeAndLit: do it pomp
4:33:51 | GamerOnTheInternet: ok im leave bye bye :D
4:33:54 | Yxoko: shounic can you delete the femboys please i don't like it
4:33:56 | Kritzmaker: caves dont have doors, we should do it for realism
4:33:58 | tommya: Skibidi bop bop

4:34:13 | Pompmaker1: it's too late, I'm drawing it
4:34:32 | Golden Bendy: pomp noo
4:34:38 | Jhonnykiller45: You shouldn't do that.
4:34:41 | Golden Bendy: he'll get mad fr
4:34:45 | Xnery: i think there would be a lot of angles to attack the nest if the door was removed
4:34:51 | m: femboy shounic = waifu
4:34:53 | Krackin Gibbs: I think they destroyed the hall nest
4:34:59 | Kritzmaker: blue team chat: "ok so everythings split, just push the cart"
4:35:02 | Лёха Сварщик: engineer gaming
4:35:07 | Vaan: they're some kind of team fortress or something
4:35:08 | El' Stash: Pomp you gotta restrain yourself
4:35:27 | plsplsplslol: blue can also spam through that hole
4:35:37 | Yxoko: shounic can you delete the femboys please i don't like it

4:36:10 | AmazingWest: what happened to youu
4:36:11 | m: we should stop pushing things into that hole and start doing stuff with shounics
4:36:13 | Edoan: the true team fortress are the friends we made along the way
4:36:16 | Golden Bendy: the task is drawing that.
4:36:16 | Kritzmaker: remove all death planes for realism, i wanna take a swim
4:36:18 | ExEm: I think someone is making your femboy 3D
4:36:23 | tommya: Early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
4:36:26 | Louize Andrei: don't change our ways of spending our weekends we are free
4:36:37 | Worm enjoyer2015: amn is up from 7am on the cat femboy drawing grind
4:36:39 | Yxoko: shounic can you delete the femboys please i don't like it please :((

4:38:12 | Golden Bendy: no, use a live2d of demo
4:38:14 | Louize Andrei: you see the trick is just to say you're not a vtuber
4:38:17 | Edoan: shounic uses an anime avatar, mass hysteria occur
