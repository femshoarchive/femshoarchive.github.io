<Viewer flipped={true} title="thatrandomguy7809's FemShoe skin" description="This one was the first. This one has more toned-down colors, 2x2 eyes and your typical boy skin hairstyle. Lack of shading and gray-ish shade of pink on the thigh-highs makes this skin look way worse compared to Pompmaker's. Not like I hate the skin or its author, I'm just saying that the skin deserves some improvements." file="/skins/thatrandomguy7809.png"/>
<Viewer flipped={false} title="Pompmaker1's FemShoe skin" description="This is the second skin ever made of FemShoe. I was actually surprised someone else also made a FemShoe skin. This skin has way darker and more saturated colors, TF2 logo has way more detail, there's shading. The only things I don't like in this skin are the eyes and the cheeks. Also I'm just subjectively reviewing both skins and whatnot." file="/skins/pompmaker1.png"/>
